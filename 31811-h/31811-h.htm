5</span>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<p>Plutarch, the most famous biographer of ancient times, is of
opinion that the uses of telling the history of the men of past
ages are to teach wisdom, and to show us by their example how
best to spend life.&nbsp; His method is to relate the history of
a Greek statesman or soldier, then the history of a Roman whose
opportunities of fame resembled those of the Greek, and finally
to compare the two.&nbsp; He points out how in the same straits
the one hero had shown wisdom, the other imprudence; and that he
who had on one occasion fallen short of greatness had on another
displayed the highest degree of manly virtue or of genius.&nbsp;
If Plutarch&rsquo;s method of teaching should ever be followed by
an English biographer, he will surely place side by side and
compare two English naturalists, Gilbert White and Charles
Waterton.&nbsp; White was a clergyman of the Church of England,
educated at Oxford.&nbsp; Waterton was a Roman Catholic country
gentleman, who received his education in a Jesuit college.&nbsp;
White spent his life in the south of England, and never
travelled.&nbsp; Waterton lived in the north of England, and
spent more than ten years in the Forests <!-- page 6--><a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>of
Guiana.&nbsp; With all these points of difference, the two
naturalists were men of the same kind, and whose lives both teach
the same lesson.&nbsp; They are examples to show that if a man
will but look carefully round him in the country his every-day
walk may supply him with an enjoyment costing nothing, but
surpassed by none which wealth can procure; with food for
reflection however long he may live; with problems of which it
will be an endless pleasure to attempt the solution; with a
spectacle of Infinite Wisdom which will fill his mind with awe
and with a constantly increasing assurance of Infinite Goodness,
which will do much to help him in all the trials of life.&nbsp;
He who lives in the country and has the love of outdoor natural
history in his heart, will never be lonely and never dull.&nbsp;
Waterton himself thought that this love of natural history must
be inborn and could not be acquired.&nbsp; If this be so, they
ought indeed to be thankful who possess so happy a gift.&nbsp;
Even if Waterton&rsquo;s opinion be not absolutely true, it is at
least certain that the taste for outdoor observation can only be
acquired in the field, and that this acquisition is rarely made
after the period of boyhood.&nbsp; How important, then, to excite
the attention of children in the country to the sights around
them.&nbsp; A few will remain apathetic, the tastes of some will
lie in other directions, but the time will not be lost, for some
will certainly take to natural history, and will have happiness
from it throughout life.&nbsp; No study is more <!-- page 7--><a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>likely to
confirm them in that content of which a favourite poet of
Waterton&rsquo;s truly says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Content is wealth, the riches of the
mind,<br />
And happy he who can that treasure find.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gilbert White and Charles Waterton are pre-eminent among
English naturalists for their complete devotion to the study;
both excelled as observers, and the writings of both combine the
interest of exact outdoor observation with the charm of good
literature.&nbsp; Waterton was born on June 3rd, 1782, at Walton
Hall, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, a place which had for
several centuries been the seat of his family.&nbsp; His father,
Thomas Waterton, was a squire, fond of fox-hunting, but with
other tastes, well read in literature, and delighting in the
observation of the ways of birds and beasts.&nbsp; His
grandfather, whose grave is beneath the most northern of a row of
old elm trees in the park, was imprisoned in York on account of
his known attachment to the cause of the Young Pretender.&nbsp;
As he meant to join the rebel forces, the imprisonment probably
saved his own life and prevented the ruin of the family.&nbsp; In
his grandson&rsquo;s old age, when another white-haired Yorkshire
squire was dining at Walton Hall, I remember that Waterton and he
reminded one another that their grandfathers had planned to march
together to Prince Charley, and that they themselves, so
differently are the rights of kings regarded at different ages,
<!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>when schoolboys together, had gone a-bird&rsquo;s-nesting
on a day, in 1793, set apart for mourning for the decapitation of
Louis XVI.&nbsp; Waterton has himself told the history of his
earlier ancestors in an autobiography which he wrote in
1837:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The poet tells us, that the good qualities of man and
of cattle descend to their offspring.&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>Fortes
creantur fortibus et bonis</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; If this holds good,
I ought to be pretty well off, as far as breeding goes; for, on
the father&rsquo;s side, I come in a direct line from Sir Thomas
More, through my grandmother; whilst by the mother&rsquo;s side I
am akin to the Bedingfelds of Oxburgh, to the Charltons of
Hazelside, and to the Swinburnes of Capheaton.&nbsp; My family
has been at Walton Hall for some centuries.&nbsp; It emigrated
into Yorkshire from Waterton, in the island of Axeholme in
Lincolnshire, where it had been for a very long time.&nbsp;
Indeed, I dare say I could trace it up to Father Adam, if my
progenitors had only been as careful in preserving family records
as the Arabs are in recording the pedigree of their horses; for I
do most firmly believe that we are all descended from Adam and
his wife Eve, notwithstanding what certain self-sufficient
philosophers may have advanced to the contrary.&nbsp; Old Matt
Prior had probably an opportunity of laying his hands on family
papers of the same purport as those which I have not been able to
find; for he positively informs us that Adam and Eve were his
ancestors:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>&lsquo;Gentlemen, here, by your
leave,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lie the bones of Matthew Prior,<br />
A son of Adam and of Eve:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Can Bourbon or Nassau go higher?&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Depend upon it, the man under Afric&rsquo;s burning zone, and
he from the frozen regions of the North, have both come from the
same stem.&nbsp; Their difference in colour and in feature may be
traced to this: viz., that the first has had too much, and the
second too little, sun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In remote times, some of my ancestors were sufficiently
notorious to have had their names handed down to posterity.&nbsp;
They fought at Cressy, and at Agincourt, and at Marston
Moor.&nbsp; Sir Robert Waterton was Governor of Pontefract
Castle, and had charge of King Richard II.&nbsp; Sir Hugh
Waterton was executor to his Sovereign&rsquo;s will, and guardian
to his daughters.&nbsp; Another ancestor was sent into France by
the King, with orders to contract a royal marriage.&nbsp; He was
allowed thirteen shillings a day for his trouble and travelling
expenses.&nbsp; Another was Lord Chancellor of England, and
preferred to lose his head rather than sacrifice his
conscience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Waterton&rsquo;s childhood was spent at Walton Hall, and in
his old age he used sometimes to recall the songs of his
nurses.&nbsp; &ldquo;One of them,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is the
only poem in which the owl is pitied.&nbsp; She sang it to the
tune of &lsquo;Cease, rude Boreas, blustering railer,&rsquo; and
the words are affecting:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>&lsquo;Once I was a monarch&rsquo;s
daughter,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And sat on a lady&rsquo;s knee;<br />
But am now a nightly rover,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Banished to the ivy tree.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Crying, Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hoo, hoo, my feet are cold!<br />
Pity me, for here you see me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Persecuted, poor, and old.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He was already proficient in bird&rsquo;s-nesting when, in
1792, he was sent to a school kept by a Roman Catholic priest,
the Reverend Arthur Storey, at Tudhoe, then a small village, five
miles from Durham.&nbsp; Three years before his death he wrote an
account of his schooldays, which is printed in the Life prefixed
to Messrs. Warne&rsquo;s edition of his &ldquo;Natural History
Essays.&rdquo;&nbsp; The honourable character of the
schoolmaster, and the simple, adventurous disposition of his
pupil, are vividly depicted in this account.&nbsp; The following
quotations from it show that preparatory schools were less
luxurious in the last century than they commonly are at the
present day:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now let me enter into the minuti&aelig; of Tudhoe
School.&nbsp; Mr. Storey had two wigs, one of which was of a
flaxen colour, without powder, and had only one lower row of
curls.&nbsp; The other had two rows, and was exceedingly well
powdered.&nbsp; When he appeared in the schoolroom with this last
wig on, I know that I was safe from the birch, as he invariably
went to Durham and spent the day there.&nbsp; But when I saw that
he had <!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>his flaxen wig on, my countenance
fell.&nbsp; He was in the schoolroom all day, and I was too often
placed in a very uncomfortable position at nightfall.&nbsp; But
sometimes I had to come in contact with the birch-rod for various
frolics independent of school erudition.&nbsp; I once smarted
severely for an act of kindness.&nbsp; We had a boy named Bryan
Salvin, from Croxdale Hall.&nbsp; He was a dull, sluggish, and
unwieldy lad, quite incapable of climbing exertions.&nbsp; Being
dissatisfied with the regulations of the establishment, he came
to me one Palm Sunday, and entreated me to get into the
schoolroom through the window, and write a letter of complaint to
his sister Eliza in York.&nbsp; I did so, having insinuated
myself with vast exertion through the iron stanchions which
secured the window; &lsquo;<i>sed revocare
gradum</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; Whilst I was thrusting might and main
through the stanchions, on my way out&mdash;suddenly, oh,
horrible! the schoolroom door flew open, and on the threshold
stood the Reverend Mr. Storey&mdash;a fiery, frightful,
formidable spectre!&nbsp; To my horror and confusion I drove my
foot quite through a pane of glass, and there I stuck, impaled
and imprisoned, but luckily not injured by the broken
glass.&nbsp; Whilst I was thus in unexpected captivity, he cried
out, in an angry voice, &lsquo;So you are there, Master Charles,
are you?&rsquo;&nbsp; He got assistance, and they pulled me back
by main force.&nbsp; But as this was Palm Sunday my execution was
obligingly deferred until Monday morning.</p>
<p><!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>&ldquo;But let us return to Tudhoe.&nbsp; In my time it
was a peaceful, healthy farming village, and abounded in local
curiosities.&nbsp; Just on the king&rsquo;s highway, betwixt
Durham and Bishop-Auckland, and one field from the school, there
stood a public-house called the &lsquo;White Horse,&rsquo; and
kept by a man of the name of Charlton.&nbsp; He had a real gaunt
English mastiff, half-starved for want of food, and so ferocious
that nobody but himself dared to approach it.&nbsp; This publican
had also a mare, surprising in her progeny; she had three foals,
in three successive years, not one of which had the least
appearance of a tail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of Mr. Storey&rsquo;s powdered wigs was of so
tempting an aspect, on the shelf where it was laid up in
ordinary, that the cat actually kittened in it.&nbsp; I saw her
and her little ones all together in the warm wig.&nbsp; He also
kept a little white and black bitch, apparently of King
Charles&rsquo;s breed.&nbsp; One evening, as we scholars were
returning from a walk, Chloe started a hare, which we surrounded
and captured, and carried in triumph to oily Mrs. Atkinson, who
begged us a play-day for our success.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On Easter Sunday Mr. Storey always treated us to
&lsquo;Pasche eggs.&rsquo;&nbsp; They were boiled hard in a
concoction of whin-flowers, which rendered them beautifully
purple.&nbsp; We used them for warlike purposes, by holding them
betwixt our forefinger and thumb with the sharp end upwards, and
as little exposed as possible.&nbsp; <!-- page 13--><a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>An antagonist
then approached, and with the sharp end of his own egg struck
this egg.&nbsp; If he succeeded in cracking it, the vanquished
egg was his; and he either sold it for a halfpenny in the market,
or reserved it for his own eating.&nbsp; When all the sharp ends
had been crushed, then the blunt ends entered into battle.&nbsp;
Thus nearly every Pasche egg in the school had its career of
combat.&nbsp; The possessor of a strong egg with a thick shell
would sometimes vanquish a dozen of his opponents, all of which
the conqueror ultimately transferred into his own stomach, when
no more eggs with unbroken ends remained to carry on the war of
Easter Week.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The little black and white bitch once began to snarl,
and then to bark at me, when I was on a roving expedition in
quest of hens&rsquo; nests.&nbsp; I took up half a brick and
knocked it head over heels.&nbsp; Mr. Storey was watching at the
time from one of the upper windows; but I had not seen him, until
I heard the sound of his magisterial voice.&nbsp; He beckoned me
to his room there and then, and whipped me soundly for my
pains.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four of us scholars stayed at Tudhoe during the summer
vacation, when all the rest had gone home.&nbsp; Two of these had
dispositions as malicious as those of two old apes.&nbsp; One
fine summer&rsquo;s morning they decoyed me into a field (I was
just then from my mother&rsquo;s nursery) where there was a flock
of geese.&nbsp; They assured me that the geese had no right to be
there; <!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>and that it was necessary we should
kill them, as they were trespassing on our master&rsquo;s
grass.&nbsp; The scamps then furnished me with a
hedge-stake.&nbsp; On approaching the flock, behold the gander
came out to meet me; and whilst he was hissing defiance at us, I
struck him on the neck, and killed him outright.&nbsp; My
comrades immediately took to flight, and on reaching the house
informed our master of what I had done.&nbsp; But when he heard
my unvarnished account of the gander&rsquo;s death, he did not
say one single unkind word to me, but scolded most severely the
two boys who had led me into the scrape.&nbsp; The geese belonged
to a farmer named John Hey, whose son Ralph used to provide me
with birds&rsquo; eggs.&nbsp; Ever after when I passed by his
house, some of the children would point to me and say, &lsquo;Yaw
killed aur guise.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At Bishop-Auckland there lived a man by the name of
Charles the Painter.&nbsp; He played extremely well on the
Northumberland bagpipe, and his neighbour was a good performer on
the flageolet.&nbsp; When we had pleased our master by continued
good conduct, he would send for these two musicians, who gave us
a delightful evening concert in the general play-room, Mr. Storey
himself supplying an extra treat of fruit, cakes, and tea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tudhoe had her own ghosts and spectres, just as the
neighbouring villages had theirs.&nbsp; One was the Tudhoe mouse,
well known and often seen in every <!-- page 15--><a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>house in the
village; but I cannot affirm that I myself ever saw it.&nbsp; It
was an enormous mouse, of a dark brown colour, and did an
immensity of mischief.&nbsp; No cat could face it; and as it
wandered through the village, all the dogs would take off,
frightened out of their wits, and howling as they ran away.&nbsp;
William Wilkinson, Mr. Storey&rsquo;s farming man, told me he had
often seen it, but that it terrified him to such a degree that he
could not move from the place where he was standing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our master kept a large tom-cat in the house.&nbsp; A
fine young man, in the neighbouring village of Ferry-hill, had
been severely bitten by a cat, and he died raving mad.&nbsp; On
the day that we got this information from Timothy Pickering, the
carpenter at Tudhoe, I was on the prowl for adventures, and in
passing through Mr. Storey&rsquo;s back kitchen, his big black
cat came up to me.&nbsp; Whilst I was tickling its bushy tail, it
turned round upon me, and gave me a severe bite in the calf of
the leg.&nbsp; This I kept a profound secret, but I was quite
sure I should go mad every day, for many months afterwards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a blacksmith&rsquo;s shop leading down the
village to Tudhoe Old Hall.&nbsp;&nbsp; Just opposite this shop
was a pond, on the other side of the road.&nbsp; When any sudden
death was to take place, or any sudden ill to befall the village,
a large black horse used to emerge from it, and walk slowly up
and down the village, carrying a rider <!-- page 16--><a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>without a
head.&nbsp; The blacksmith&rsquo;s grandfather, his father,
himself, his three sons, and two daughters, had seen this
midnight apparition rise out of the pond, and return to it before
the break of day.&nbsp; John Hickson and Neddy Hunt, two
hangers-on at the blacksmith&rsquo;s shop, had seen this phantom
more than once, but they never durst approach it.&nbsp; Indeed,
every man and woman and child believed in this centaur-spectre,
and I am not quite sure if our old master himself did not partly
believe that such a thing had occasionally been seen on very dark
nights.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tudhoe has no river, a misfortune &lsquo;<i>valde
deflendus</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; In other respects the vicinity was
charming; and it afforded an ample supply of woods and hedgerow
trees to insure a sufficient stock of carrion crows, jackdaws,
jays, magpies, brown owls, kestrels, merlins, and sparrow-hawks,
for the benefit of natural history and my own instruction and
amusement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1796 Waterton left Tudhoe school and went to Stonyhurst
College in Lancashire.&nbsp; It was a country house of the
picturesque style of King James I., which had just been made over
by Mr. Weld of Lulworth to the Jesuits expelled from
Li&eacute;ge.&nbsp; The country round Stonyhurst is varied by
hills and streams, and there are mountains at no great
distance.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Whernside, Pendle Hill, and
Ingleboro&rsquo;,<br />
Three higher hills you&rsquo;ll not find England
thoro&rsquo;,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>as they are described, with equal disregard of exact <!-- page
17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>mensuration and of rhythm, in a local rhyme which
Waterton learned.&nbsp; Curlew used to fly by in flocks, and the
country people had also a rhyme about the curlew:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Be she white or be she black,<br />
She carries sixpence on her back,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which Waterton used to say showed how our ancestors valued the
bird at table.</p>
<p>At Stonyhurst he read a good deal of Latin and of English
literature, and acquired a taste for writing Latin verse.&nbsp;
He always looked back on his education there with satisfaction,
and in after-life often went to visit the college.&nbsp;
Throughout life he never drank wine, and this fortunate habit was
the result of the good advice of one of his teachers:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My master was Father Clifford, a first cousin of the
noble lord of that name.&nbsp; He had left the world, and all its
alluring follies, that he might serve Almighty God more
perfectly, and work his way with more security up to the regions
of eternal bliss.&nbsp; After educating those entrusted to his
charge with a care and affection truly paternal, he burst a
blood-vessel, and retired to Palermo for the benefit of a warmer
climate.&nbsp; There he died the death of the just, in the habit
of St. Ignatius.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One day, when I was in the class of poetry, and which
was about two years before I left the college for good and all,
he called me up to his room.&nbsp; &lsquo;Charles,&rsquo; <!--
page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>said he to me, in a tone of voice perfectly
irresistible, &lsquo;I have long been studying your disposition,
and I clearly foresee that nothing will keep you at home.&nbsp;
You will journey into far-distant countries, where you will be
exposed to many dangers.&nbsp; There is only one way for you to
escape them.&nbsp; Promise me that, from this day forward, you
will never put your lips to wine, or to spirituous
liquors.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;The sacrifice is nothing,&rsquo;
added he; &lsquo;but, in the end, it will prove of incalculable
advantage to you.&rsquo;&nbsp; I agreed to his enlightened
proposal; and from that hour to this, which is now about
nine-and-thirty years, I have never swallowed one glass of any
kind of wine or of ardent spirits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After leaving college Waterton stayed at home with his father,
and enjoyed fox-hunting for a while.&nbsp; To the end of his days
he liked to hear of a good run, and he would now and then look
with pleasure on an engraving which hung in the usual dining-room
at Walton Hall, representing Lord Darlington, the first master of
hounds he had known, well seated on a powerful horse and
surrounded by very muscular hounds.&nbsp; In 1802 he went to
visit two uncles in Spain, and stayed for more than a year, and
there had a terrible experience of pestilence and of
earthquake:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There began to be reports spread up and down the city
that the black vomit had made its appearance; and every
succeeding day brought testimony that things were not as they
ought to be.&nbsp; I myself, in an <!-- page 19--><a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>alley near my
uncles&rsquo; house, saw a mattress of most suspicious appearance
hung out to dry.&nbsp; A Maltese captain, who had dined with us
in good health at one o&rsquo;clock, lay dead in his cabin before
sunrise the next morning.&nbsp; A few days after this I was
seized with vomiting and fever during the night.&nbsp; I had the
most dreadful spasms, and it was supposed that I could not last
out till noon the next day.&nbsp; However, strength of
constitution got me through it.&nbsp; In three weeks more,
multitudes were seen to leave the city, which shortly after was
declared to be in a state of pestilence.&nbsp; Some affirmed that
the disorder had come from the Levant; others said that it had
been imported from the Havanna; but I think it probable that
nobody could tell in what quarter it had originated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had now all retired to the country-house&mdash;my
eldest uncle returning to Malaga from time to time, according as
the pressure of business demanded his presence in the city.&nbsp;
He left us one Sunday evening, and said he would be back again
some time on Monday; but that was my poor uncle&rsquo;s last
day&rsquo;s ride.&nbsp; On arriving at his house in Malaga, there
was a messenger waiting to inform him that Father Bustamante had
fallen sick, and wished to see him.&nbsp; Father Bustamante was
an aged priest, who had been particularly kind to my uncle on his
first arrival in Malaga.&nbsp; My uncle went immediately to
Father Bustamante, gave him every consolation in his power, and
then returned to his own <!-- page 20--><a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>house very
unwell, there to die a martyr to his charity.&nbsp; Father
Bustamante breathed his last before daylight; my uncle took to
his bed, and never rose more.&nbsp; As soon as we had received
information of his sickness, I immediately set out on foot for
the city.&nbsp; His friend, Mr. Power, now of Gibraltar, was
already in his room, doing everything that friendship could
suggest or prudence dictate.&nbsp; My uncle&rsquo;s athletic
constitution bore up against the disease much longer than we
thought it possible.&nbsp; He struggled with it for five days,
and sank at last about the hour of sunset.&nbsp; He stood six
feet four inches high; and was of so kind and generous a
disposition, that he was beloved by all who knew him.&nbsp; Many
a Spanish tear flowed when it was known that he had ceased to
be.&nbsp; We got him a kind of coffin made, in which he was
conveyed at midnight to the outskirts of the town, there to be
put into one of the pits which the galley-slaves had dug during
the day for the reception of the dead.&nbsp; But they could not
spare room for the coffin; so the body was taken out of it, and
thrown upon the heap which already occupied the pit.&nbsp; A
Spanish marquis lay just below him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thousands died as though they had been seized with
cholera, others with black vomit, and others of decided yellow
fever.&nbsp; There were a few instances of some who departed this
life with very little pain or bad symptoms: they felt unwell,
they went to bed, they <!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>had an idea that they would not get
better, and they expired in a kind of slumber.&nbsp; It was sad
in the extreme to see the bodies placed in the streets at the
close of day, to be ready for the dead-carts as they passed
along.&nbsp; The dogs howled fearfully during the night.&nbsp;
All was gloom and horror in every street; and you might see the
vultures on the strand tugging at the bodies which were washed
ashore by the eastern wind.&nbsp; It was always said that 50,000
people left the city at the commencement of the pestilence; and
that 14,000 of those who remained in it fell victims to the
disease.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was an intrigue going on at court, for the
interest of certain powerful people, to keep the port of Malaga
closed long after the city had been declared free from the
disorder; so that none of the vessels in the mole could obtain
permission to depart for their destination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the meantime the city was shaken with earthquakes;
shock succeeding shock, till we all imagined that a catastrophe
awaited us similar to that which had taken place at Lisbon.&nbsp;
The pestilence killed you by degrees, and its approaches were
sufficiently slow, in general, to enable you to submit to it with
firmness and resignation; but the idea of being swallowed up
alive by the yawning earth at a moment&rsquo;s notice, made you
sick at heart, and rendered you almost fearful of your own
shadow.&nbsp; The first shock took place at six in the evening,
with a noise as though a thousand carriages <!-- page 22--><a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>had dashed
against each other.&nbsp; This terrified many people to such a
degree that they paced all night long up and down the Alameda, or
public walk, rather than retire to their homes.&nbsp; I went to
bed a little after midnight, but was roused by another shock
about five o&rsquo;clock in the morning.&nbsp; It gave the bed a
motion which made me fancy that it moved under me from side to
side.&nbsp; I sprang up, and having put on my unmentionables (we
wore no trousers in those days), I ran out, in all haste, to the
Alameda.&nbsp; There the scene was most distressing: multitudes
of both sexes, some nearly in a state of nudity, and others sick
at stomach, were huddled together, not knowing which way to turn
or what to do.</p>
<blockquote><p>&mdash;&lsquo;Omnes eodem cogimur.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, it pleased Heaven, in its mercy, to spare us.&nbsp;
The succeeding shocks became weaker and weaker, till at last we
felt no more of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A courageous sea-captain at last sailed away in safety, though
chased by the Spanish brigs of war, and after thirty days at sea
Waterton landed in England.</p>
<p>Another uncle had estates in Demerara, and in the autumn
Waterton sailed thither from Portsmouth.&nbsp; He landed at
Georgetown, Demerara, in November, 1804, and was soon delighted
by the natural history of the tropical forest.&nbsp; In 1806 his
father died, and he returned to England.&nbsp; He made four more
journeys to Guiana, and, in 1825, published an account of them,
entitled <!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>&ldquo;Wanderings in South America,
the North-West of the United States, and the Antilles, in the
years 1812, 1816, 1820, and 1824; with original instructions for
the perfect preservation of birds, &amp;c., for cabinets of
natural history.&rdquo;&nbsp; The two first journeys are now
reprinted from the original text.&nbsp; The book at once
attracted general attention, became popular, and has taken a
place among permanent English literature.&nbsp; Unlike most
travellers, Waterton tells nothing of his personal difficulties
and discomforts, and encumbers his pages with neither statistics
nor information of the guidebook kind.&nbsp; His observation of
birds and beasts, written down in the forests, and the
description of the forests themselves, fill all his pages.&nbsp;
The great ant-eater and the sloth were for the first time
accurately described by him.&nbsp; He showed that the sloth,
instead of being a deformed, unhappy creature, was admirably
adapted to its habitat.&nbsp; He explained the use of the great
claws of the ant-eater, and the curious gait which they
necessitated.&nbsp; The habits of the toucan, of the houtou, of
the campanero, and of many other birds, were first correctly
described by him.&nbsp; He determined to catch a cayman or
alligator, and at last hooked one with a curious wooden hook of
four barbs made for him by an Indian.</p>
<p>The adventure which followed is perhaps one of the most famous
exploits of an English naturalist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We found a cayman, ten feet and a half long, fast <!--
page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>to the end of the rope.&nbsp; Nothing now remained to
do, but to get him out of the water without injuring his scales,
&lsquo;hoc opus, hic labor.&rsquo;&nbsp; We mustered strong:
there were three Indians from the creek, there was my own Indian,
Yan; Daddy Quashi, <a name="citation24"></a><a href="#footnote24"
class="citation">[24]</a> the negro from Mrs. Peterson&rsquo;s;
James, Mr. R. Edmonstone&rsquo;s man, whom I was instructing to
preserve birds; and, lastly, myself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I informed the Indians that it was my intention to draw
him quietly out of the water, and then secure him.&nbsp; They
looked and stared at each other, and said I might do it myself,
but they would have no hand in it; the cayman would worry some of
us.&nbsp; On saying this, &lsquo;consedere duces,&rsquo; they
squatted on their hams with the most perfect indifference.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Indians of those wilds have never been subject to
the least restraint; and I knew enough of them to be aware, that
if I tried to force them against their will, they would take off,
and leave me and my presents unheeded, and never return.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daddy Quashi was for applying to our guns, as usual,
considering them our best and safest friends.&nbsp; I immediately
offered to knock him down for his cowardice, and he shrank back,
begging that I would <!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>be cautious, and not get myself
worried; and apologising for his own want of resolution.&nbsp; My
Indian was now in conversation with the others, and they asked me
if I would allow them to shoot a dozen arrows into him, and thus
disable him.&nbsp; This would have ruined all.&nbsp; I had come
above three hundred miles on purpose to get a cayman uninjured,
and not to carry back a mutilated specimen.&nbsp; I rejected
their proposition with firmness, and darted a disdainful eye upon
the Indians.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daddy Quashi was again beginning to remonstrate, and I
chased him on the sand-bank for a quarter of a mile.&nbsp; He
told me afterwards, he thought he should have dropped down dead
with fright, for he was firmly persuaded, if I had caught him, I
should have bundled him into the cayman&rsquo;s jaws.&nbsp; Here
then we stood, in silence, like a calm before a
thunder-storm.&nbsp; &lsquo;Hoc res summa loco.&nbsp; Scinditur
in contraria valgus.&rsquo;&nbsp; They wanted to kill him, and I
wanted to take him alive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I now walked up and down the sand, revolving a dozen
projects in my head.&nbsp; The canoe was at a considerable
distance, and I ordered the people to bring it round to the place
where we were.&nbsp; The mast was eight feet long, and not much
thicker than my wrist.&nbsp; I took it out of the canoe, and
wrapped the sail round the end of it.&nbsp; Now it appeared clear
to me, that if I went down upon one knee, and held the mast in
the same <!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>position as the soldier holds his
bayonet when rushing to the charge, I could force it down the
cayman&rsquo;s throat, should he come open-mouthed at me.&nbsp;
When this was told to the Indians, they brightened up, and said
they would help me to pull him out of the river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Brave squad!&rsquo; said I to myself,
&lsquo;&ldquo;Audax omnia perpeti,&rdquo; now that you have got
me betwixt yourselves and danger.&rsquo;&nbsp; I then mustered
all hands for the last time before the battle.&nbsp; We were,
four South American savages, two negroes from Africa, a creole
from Trinidad, and myself, a white man from Yorkshire.&nbsp; In
fact, a little Tower of Babel group, in dress, no dress, address,
and language.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daddy Quashi hung in the rear; I showed him a large
Spanish knife, which I always carried in the waistband of my
trousers: it spoke volumes to him, and he shrugged up his
shoulders in absolute despair.&nbsp; The sun was just peeping
over the high forests on the eastern hills, as if coming to look
on, and bid us act with becoming fortitude.&nbsp; I placed all
the people at the end of the rope, and ordered them to pull till
the cayman appeared on the surface of the water and then, should
he plunge, to slacken the rope and let him go again into the
deep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I now took the mast of the canoe in my hand (the sail
being tied round the end of the mast) and sank down upon one
knee, about four yards from the water&rsquo;s edge, determining
to thrust it down his throat, in case <!-- page 27--><a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>he gave me an
opportunity.&nbsp; I certainly felt somewhat uncomfortable in
this situation, and I thought of Cerberus on the other side of
the Styx ferry.&nbsp; The people pulled the cayman to the
surface; he plunged furiously as soon as he arrived in these
upper regions, and immediately went below again on their
slackening the rope.&nbsp; I saw enough not to fall in love at
first sight.&nbsp; I now told them we would run all risks, and
have him on land immediately.&nbsp; They pulled again, and out he
came&mdash;&lsquo;monstrum horrendum, informe.&rsquo;&nbsp; This
was an interesting moment.&nbsp; I kept my position firmly, with
my eye fixed steadfast on him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the time the cayman was within two yards of me, I
saw he was in a state of fear and perturbation: I instantly
dropped the mast, sprang up, and jumped on his back, turning half
round as I vaulted, so that I gained my seat with my face in a
right position.&nbsp; I immediately seized his fore-legs, and by
main force twisted them on his back; thus they served me for a
bridle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He now seemed to have recovered from his surprise, and
probably fancying himself in hostile company, be began to plunge
furiously, and lashed the sand with his long and powerful
tail.&nbsp; I was out of reach of the strokes of it, by being
near his head.&nbsp; He continued to plunge and strike, and made
my seat very uncomfortable.&nbsp; It must have been a fine sight
for an unoccupied spectator.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The people roared out in triumph, and were so
vociferous, that it was some time before they heard me tell <!--
page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>them to pull me and my beast of burthen farther
in.&nbsp; I was apprehensive the rope might break, and then there
would have been every chance of going down to the regions under
water with the cayman.&nbsp; That would have been more perilous
than Arion&rsquo;s marine morning ride:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Delphini insidens vada c&aelig;rula sulcat
Arion.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The people now dragged us about forty yards on the
sand; it was the first and last time I was ever on a
cayman&rsquo;s back.&nbsp; Should it be asked, how I managed to
keep my seat, I would answer&mdash;I hunted some years with Lord
Darlington&rsquo;s fox-hounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After repeated attempts to regain his liberty, the
cayman gave in, and became tranquil through exhaustion.&nbsp; I
now managed to do up his jaws, and firmly secured his fore-feet
in the position I had held them.&nbsp; We had now another severe
struggle for superiority, but he was soon overcome, and again
remained quiet.&nbsp; While some of the people were pressing upon
his head and shoulders, I threw myself on his tail, and by
keeping it down to the sand, prevented him from kicking up
another dust.&nbsp; He was finally conveyed to the canoe, and
then to the place where we had suspended our hammocks.&nbsp;
There I cut his throat; and after breakfast was over, commenced
the dissection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After his fourth journey Waterton occasionally travelled on
the Continent, but for the most part <!-- page 29--><a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>resided at
Walton Hall.&nbsp; In the park he made the observations
afterwards published as &ldquo;Essays on Natural History,&rdquo;
in three series, and since reprinted, with his Life and Letters,
by Messrs. Warne and Co.</p>
<p>Walton Hall is situated on an island surrounded by its ancient
moat, a lake of about five-and-twenty acres in extent.&nbsp; From
the shores of the lake the land rises; parts of the slope, and
nearly all the highest part, being covered with wood.</p>
<p>In one wood there was a large heronry, in another a
rookery.&nbsp; Several hollow trees were haunted by owls, in the
summer goat-suckers were always to be seen in the evening flying
about two oaks on the hill.&nbsp; At one end of the lake in
summer the kingfisher might be watched fishing, and throughout
the year herons waded round its shores picking up fresh-water
mussels, or stood motionless for hours, watching for fish.&nbsp;
In winter, when the lake was frozen, three or four hundred wild
duck, with teal and pochards, rested on it all day, and flew away
at night to feed; while widgeons fed by day on its shores.&nbsp;
Coots and water-hens used to come close to the windows and pick
up food put out for them.&nbsp; The Squire built a wall nine feet
high all round his park, and he used laughingly to say that he
paid for it with the cost of the wine which he did not drink
after dinner.</p>
<p>A more delightful home for a naturalist could not have
been.&nbsp; No shot was ever fired within the park <!-- page
30--><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>wall,
and every year more birds came.&nbsp; Waterton used often to
quote the lines:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;No bird that haunts my valley free<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To slaughter I condemn;<br />
Taught by the Power that pities me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I learn to pity them;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and each new-comer added to his happiness.&nbsp; In his latter
days the household usually consisted of the Squire, as he was
always called, and of his two sisters-in-law, for he had lost his
wife soon after his marriage in 1829.&nbsp; He breakfasted at
eight, dined in the middle of the day, and drank tea in the
evening.&nbsp; He went to bed early, and slept upon the bare
floor, with a block of wood for his pillow.&nbsp; He rose for the
day at half-past three, and spent the hour from four to five at
prayer in his chapel.&nbsp; He then read every morning a chapter
in a Spanish Life of St. Francis Xavier, followed by a chapter of
&ldquo;Don Quixote&rdquo; in the original, after which he used to
stuff birds or write letters till breakfast.&nbsp; Most of the
day he spent in the open air, and when the weather was cold would
light a fire of sticks and warm himself by it.&nbsp; So active
did he continue to the end of his days, that on his eightieth
birthday he climbed an oak in my company.&nbsp; He was very kind
to the poor, and threw open a beautiful part of his park to
excursionists all through the summer.&nbsp; He had a very tender
heart for beasts and birds, as well as for men.&nbsp; If a cat
looked hungry he would see that she had a meal, and sometimes
when he <!-- page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>had forgotten to put a crust of bread
in his pocket before starting on his afternoon walk, he would say
to his companion, &ldquo;How shall we ever get past that
goose?&rdquo; for there was a goose which used to wait for him in
the evening at the end of the bridge over the moat, and he could
not bear to disappoint it.&nbsp; If he could not find a bit of
food for it, he would wait at a distance till the bird went away,
rather than give it nothing when it raised its bill.</p>
<p>Towards the end of his life I enjoyed his friendship, and can
never forget his kindly welcome, his pithy conversation, the
happy humour with which he expressed the conclusions of his long
experience of men, birds and beasts, and the goodness which shone
from his face.&nbsp; I was staying at Walton when he died, and
have thus described his last hours in the biography which is
prefixed to the latest edition of his Essays. <a
name="citation31"></a><a href="#footnote31"
class="citation">[31]</a>&nbsp; I was reading for an examination,
and used, on the Squire&rsquo;s invitation, to go and chat with
him just after midnight, for at that hour be always awoke, and
paid a short visit to his chapel.&nbsp; A little before midnight
on May 24th I visited him in his room.&nbsp; He was sitting
asleep by his fire wrapped up in a large Italian cloak.</p>
<p>His head rested upon his wooden pillow, which was placed on a
table, and his thick silvery hair formed a beautiful contrast
with the dark colour of the oak.&nbsp; He soon woke up, and
withdrew to the chapel, and on his <!-- page 32--><a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>return we
talked together for three-quarters of an hour about the brown
owl, the nightjar, and other birds.&nbsp; The next morning, May
25, he was unusually cheerful, and said to me, &ldquo;That was a
very pleasant little confab we had last night: I do not suppose
there was such another going on in England at the same
time.&rdquo;&nbsp; After breakfast we went with a carpenter to
finish some bridges at the far end of the park.&nbsp; The work
was completed, and we were proceeding homewards when, in crossing
a small bridge, a bramble caught the Squire&rsquo;s foot, and he
fell heavily upon a log.&nbsp; He was greatly shaken, and said he
thought he was dying.&nbsp; He walked, notwithstanding, a little
way, and was then compelled to lie down.&nbsp; He would not
permit his sufferings to distract his mind, and he pointed out to
the carpenter some trees which were to be felled.&nbsp; He
presently continued his route, and managed to reach the spot
where the boat was moored.&nbsp; Hitherto he had refused all
assistance, but he could not step from the bank into the boat,
and he said, &ldquo;I am afraid I must ask you to help me
in.&rdquo;&nbsp; He walked from the landing-place into the house,
changed his clothes, and came and sat in the large room
below.&nbsp; The pain increasing, he rose from his seat after he
had seen his doctor, and though he had been bent double with
anguish, he persisted in walking up-stairs without help, and
would have gone to his own room in the top storey, if, for the
sake of saving trouble to others, he had not been induced to stop
half-way in <!-- page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 33</span>Miss Edmonstone&rsquo;s
sitting-room.&nbsp; Here he lay down upon the sofa, and was
attended by his sisters-in-law.&nbsp; The pain abated, and the
next day he seemed better.&nbsp; In the afternoon he talked to me
a good deal, chiefly about natural history.&nbsp; But he was well
aware of his perilous condition, for he remarked to me,
&ldquo;This is a bad business,&rdquo; and later on he felt his
pulse often, and said, &ldquo;It is a bad case.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
was more than self-possessed.&nbsp; A benignant cheerfulness
beamed from his mind, and in the fits of pain he frequently
looked up with a gentle smile, and made some little joke.&nbsp;
Towards midnight he grew worse.&nbsp; The priest, the Reverend R.
Browne, was summoned, and Waterton got ready to die.&nbsp; He
pulled himself upright without help, sat in the middle of the
sofa, and gave his blessing in turn to his grandson, Charlie, to
his granddaughter, Mary, to each of his sisters-in-law, to his
niece, and to myself, and left a message for his son, who was
hastening back from Rome.&nbsp; He then received the last
sacraments, repeated all the responses, Saint Bernard&rsquo;s
hymn in English, and the first two verses of the <i>Dies
Ir&aelig;</i>.&nbsp; The end was now at hand, and he died at
twenty-seven minutes past two in the morning of May 27,
1865.&nbsp; The window was open.&nbsp; The sky was beginning to
grow grey, a few rooks had cawed, the swallows were twittering,
the landrail was craking from the Ox-close, and a favourite cock,
which he used to call <!-- page 34--><a name="page34"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>his morning gun, leaped out from some
hollies, and gave his accustomed crow.&nbsp; The ear of his
master was deaf to the call.&nbsp; He had obeyed a sublimer
summons, and had woke up to the glories of the eternal world.</p>
<p>He was buried on his birthday, the 3rd of June, between two
great oaks at the far end of the lake, the oldest trees in the
park.&nbsp; He had put up a rough stone cross to mark the spot
where he wished to be buried.&nbsp; Often on summer days he had
sat in the shade of these oaks watching the kingfishers.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Cock Robin and the magpies,&rdquo; he said to me as we sat
by the trees one day, &ldquo;will mourn my loss, and you will
sometimes remember me when I lie here.&rdquo;&nbsp; At the foot
of the cross is a Latin inscription which he wrote himself.&nbsp;
It could hardly be simpler: &ldquo;Pray for the soul of Charles
Waterton, whose tired bones are buried near this
cross.&rdquo;&nbsp; The dates of his birth and death are
added.</p>
<p>Walton Hall is no longer the home of the Watertons, the oaks
are too old to flourish many years more, and in time the stone
cross may be overthrown and the exact burial place of Waterton be
forgotten; but his &ldquo;Wanderings in South America&rdquo; and
his &ldquo;Natural History Essays&rdquo; will always be read, and
are for him a memorial like that claimed by the poet he read
oftenest&mdash;</p>

Nec poterit ferrum, nec edax abolere vetustas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the month of April, 1812, I left the town of Stabroek, to
travel through the wilds of Demerara and Essequibo, a part of
<i>ci-devant</i> Dutch Guiana, in South America.</p>
<p>The chief objects in view were to collect a quantity of the
strongest wourali-poison; and to reach the inland frontier fort
of Portuguese Guiana.</p>
<p>It would be a tedious journey for him who wishes to travel
through these wilds to set out from Stabroek on foot.&nbsp; The
sun would exhaust him in his attempts to wade through the swamps,
and the mosquitos at night would deprive him of every hour of
sleep.</p>
<p>The road for horses runs parallel to the river, but it extends
a very little way, and even ends before the cultivation of the
plantation ceases.</p>
<p><!-- page 36--><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>The only mode then that remains is to proceed by water;
and when you come to the high lands, you may make your way
through the forest on foot, or continue your route on the
river.</p>
<p>After passing the third island in the river Demerara, there
are few plantations to be seen, and those not joining on to one
another, but separated by large tracts of wood.</p>
<p>The Loo is the last where the sugar-cane is growing.&nbsp; The
greater part of its negroes have just been ordered to another
estate; and ere a few months shall have elapsed all signs of
cultivation will be lost in under-wood.</p>
<p>Higher up stand the sugar-works of Amelia&rsquo;s Waard,
solitary and abandoned; and after passing these there is not a
ruin to inform the traveller that either coffee or sugar has been
cultivated.</p>
<p>From Amelia&rsquo;s Waard an unbroken range of forest covers
each bank of the river, saving here and there where a hut
discovers itself, inhabited by free people of colour, with a rood
or two of bared ground about it; or where the wood-cutter has
erected himself a dwelling, and cleared a few acres for
pasturage.&nbsp; Sometimes you see level ground on each side of
you for two or three hours at a stretch; at other times a gently
sloping hill presents itself; and often, on turning a point, the
eye is pleased with the contrast <!-- page 37--><a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>of an almost
perpendicular height jutting into the water.&nbsp; The trees put
you in mind of an eternal spring, with summer and autumn kindly
blended into it.</p>
<p>Here you may see a sloping extent of noble trees, whose
foliage displays a charming variety of every shade from the
lightest to the darkest green and purple.&nbsp; The tops of some
are crowned with bloom of the loveliest hue; while the boughs of
others bend with a profusion of seeds and fruits.</p>
<p>Those whose heads have been bared by time, or blasted by the
thunder-storm, strike the eye, as a mournful sound does the ear
in music; and seem to beckon to the sentimental traveller to stop
a moment or two, and see that the forests which surround him,
like men and kingdoms, have their periods of misfortune and
decay.</p>
<p>The first rocks of any considerable size that are observed on
the side of the river are at a place called Saba, from the Indian
word, which means a stone.&nbsp; They appear sloping down to the
water&rsquo;s edge, not shelvy, but smooth, and their exuberances
rounded off, and, in some places, deeply furrowed, as though they
had been worn with continual floods of water.</p>
<p>There are patches of soil up and down, and the huge stones
amongst them produce a pleasing and novel effect.&nbsp; You see a
few coffee-trees of a fine luxuriant <!-- page 38--><a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>growth; and
nearly on the top of Saba stands the house of the
post-holder.</p>
<p>He is appointed by government to give in his report to the
protector of the Indians of what is going on amongst them, and to
prevent suspicious people from passing up the river.</p>
<p>When the Indians assemble here the stranger may have an
opportunity of seeing the aborigines dancing to the sound of
their country music, and painted in their native style.&nbsp;
They will shoot their arrows for him with an unerring aim, and
send the poisoned dart from the blow-pipe true to its
destination; and here he may often view all the different shades,
from the red savage to the white man, and from the white man to
the sootiest son of Africa.</p>
<p>Beyond this post there are no more habitations of white men,
or free people of colour.</p>
<p>In a country so extensively covered with wood as this is,
having every advantage that a tropical sun and the richest mould,
in many places, can give to vegetation, it is natural to look for
trees of very large dimensions; but it is rare to meet with them
above six yards in circumference.&nbsp; If larger have ever
existed, they had fallen a sacrifice either to the axe or to
fire.</p>
<p>If, however, they disappoint you in size, they make ample
amends in height.&nbsp; Heedless and bankrupt in all curiosity
must he be who can journey on without <!-- page 39--><a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>stopping to
take a view of the towering mora.&nbsp; Its topmost branch, when
naked with age or dried by accident, is the favourite resort of
the toucan.&nbsp; Many a time has this singular bird felt the
shot faintly strike him from the gun of the fowler beneath, and
owed his life to the distance betwixt them.</p>
<p>The trees which form these far-extending wilds are as useful
as they are ornamental.&nbsp; It would take a volume of itself to
describe them.</p>
<p>The green-heart, famous for its hardness and durability; the
hackea, for its toughness; the ducalabali, surpassing mahogany;
the ebony and letter-wood vieing with the choicest woods of the
old world; the locust tree, yielding copal; and the hayawa and
olon trees, furnishing a sweet-smelling resin, are all to be met
with in the forest, betwixt the plantations and the rock
Saba.</p>
<p>Beyond this rock the country has been little explored; but it
is very probable that these, and a vast collection of other
kinds, and possibly many new species, are scattered up and down,
in all directions, through the swamps, and hills, and savannas of
<i>ci-devant</i> Dutch Guiana.</p>
<p>On viewing the stately trees around him the naturalist will
observe many of them bearing leaves, and blossoms, and fruit, not
their own.</p>
<p>The wild fig-tree, as large as a common English <!-- page
40--><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>apple-tree, often rears itself from one of the thick
branches at the top of the mora; and when its fruit is ripe, to
it the birds resort for nourishment.&nbsp; It was to an
undigested seed, passing through the body of the bird which had
perched on the mora, that the fig-tree first owed its elevated
station there.&nbsp; The sap of the mora raised it into full
bearing; but now, in its turn, it is doomed to contribute a
portion of its own sap and juices towards the growth of different
species of vines, the seeds of which, also, the birds deposited
on its branches.&nbsp; These soon vegetate, and bear fruit in
great quantities; so what with their usurpation of the resources
of the fig-tree, and the fig-tree of the mora, the mora, unable
to support a charge which nature never intended it should,
languishes and dies under its burden; and then the fig-tree, and
its usurping progeny of vines, receiving no more succour from
their late foster-parent, droop and perish in their turn.</p>
<p>A vine called the bush-rope by the wood-cutters, on account of
its use in hauling out the heaviest timber, has a singular
appearance in the forests of Demerara.&nbsp; Sometimes you see it
nearly as thick as a man&rsquo;s body, twisted like a cork-screw
round the tallest trees, and rearing its head high above their
tops.&nbsp; At other times three or four of them, like strands in
a cable, join tree and tree and branch and branch together.&nbsp;
Others, descending from on high, take root as soon as their <!--
page 41--><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
41</span>extremity touches the ground, and appear like shrouds
and stays supporting the main-mast of a line-of-battle ship;
while others, sending out parallel, oblique, horizontal, and
perpendicular shoots in all directions, put you in mind of what
travellers call a matted forest.&nbsp; Oftentimes a tree, above a
hundred feet high, uprooted by the whirlwind, is stopped in its
fall by these amazing cables of nature; and hence it is that you
account for the phenomenon of seeing trees not only vegetating,
but sending forth vigorous shoots, though far from their
perpendicular, and their trunks inclined to every degree from the
meridian to the horizon.</p>
<p>Their heads remain firmly supported by the bush-rope; many of
their roots soon refix themselves in the earth, and frequently a
strong shoot will sprout out perpendicularly from near the root
of the reclined trunk, and in time become a fine tree.&nbsp; No
grass grows under the trees; and few weeds, except in the
swamps.</p>
<p>The high grounds are pretty clear of underwood, and with a
cutlass to sever the small bush-ropes, it is not difficult
walking among the trees.</p>
<p>The soil, chiefly formed by the fallen leaves and decayed
trees, is very rich and fertile in the valleys.&nbsp; On the
hills it is little better than sand.&nbsp; The rains seem to have
carried away and swept into the valleys <!-- page 42--><a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>every
particle which nature intended to have formed a mould.</p>
<p>Four-footed animals are scarce, considering how very thinly
these forests are inhabited by men.</p>
<p>Several species of the animal commonly called tiger, though in
reality it approaches nearer to the leopard, are found here; and
two of their diminutives, named tiger-cats.&nbsp; The tapir, the
labba, and deer, afford excellent food, and chiefly frequent the
swamps and low ground, near the sides of the river and
creeks.</p>
<p>In stating that four-footed animals are scarce, the peccary
must be excepted.&nbsp; Three or four hundred of them herd
together, and traverse the wilds in all directions, in quest of
roots and fallen seeds.&nbsp; The Indians mostly shoot them with
poisoned arrows.&nbsp; When wounded, they run about one hundred
and fifty paces; they then drop, and make wholesome food.</p>
<p>The red monkey, erroneously called the baboon, is heard
oftener than it is seen; while the common brown monkey, the bisa,
and sacawinki, rove from tree to tree, and amuse the stranger as
he journeys on.</p>
<p>A species of the polecat, and another of the fox, are
destructive to the Indian&rsquo;s poultry; while the opossum, the
guana, and salempenta afford him a delicious morsel.</p>
<p>The small ant-bear, and the large one, remarkable for its
long, broad bushy tail, are sometimes seen on <!-- page 43--><a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>the tops of
the wood-ants&rsquo; nests; the armadillos bore in the
sand-hills, like rabbits in a warren; and the porcupine is now
and then discovered in the trees over your head.</p>
<p>This, too, is the native country of the sloth.&nbsp; His
looks, his gestures, and his cries, all conspire to entreat you
to take pity on him.&nbsp; These are the only weapons of defence
which nature has given him.&nbsp; While other animals assemble in
herds, or in pairs range through these boundless wilds, the sloth
is solitary, and almost stationary; he cannot escape from
you.&nbsp; It is said, his piteous moans make the tiger relent,
and turn out of the way.&nbsp; Do not then level your gun at him,
or pierce him with a poisoned arrow; he has never hurt one living
creature.&nbsp; A few leaves, and those of the commonest and
coarsest kind, are all he asks for his support.&nbsp; On
comparing him with other animals, you would say that you could
perceive deficiency, deformity, and superabundance in his
composition.&nbsp; He has no cutting teeth, and though four
stomachs, he still wants the long intestines of ruminating
animals.&nbsp; He has only one inferior aperture, as in
birds.&nbsp; He has no soles to his feet, nor has he the power of
moving his toes separately.&nbsp; His hair is flat, and puts you
in mind of grass withered by the wintry blast.&nbsp; His legs are
too short; they appear deformed by the manner in which they are
joined to the body; and when he is on <!-- page 44--><a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>the ground,
they seem as if only calculated to be of use in climbing
trees.&nbsp; He has forty-six ribs, while the elephant has only
forty; and his claws are disproportionably long.&nbsp; Were you
to mark down, upon a graduated scale, the different claims to
superiority amongst the four-footed animals, this poor ill-formed
creature&rsquo;s claim would be the last upon the lowest
degree.</p>
<p>Demerara yields to no country in the world in her wonderful
and beautiful productions of the feathered race.&nbsp; Here the
finest precious stones are far surpassed by the vivid tints which
adorn the birds.&nbsp; The naturalist may exclaim, that nature
has not known where to stop in forming new species, and painting
her requisite shades.&nbsp; Almost every one of those singular
and elegant birds described by Buffon as belonging to Cayenne are
to be met with in Demerara; but it is only by an indefatigable
naturalist that they are to be found.</p>
<p>The scarlet curlew breeds in innumerable quantities in the
muddy islands on the coasts of Pomauron; the egrets and crabiers
in the same place.&nbsp; They resort to the mud-flats at ebbing
water, while thousands of sandpipers and plovers, with here and
there a spoonbill and flamingo, are seen amongst them.&nbsp; The
pelicans go farther out to sea, but return at sundown to the
courada trees.&nbsp; The humming-birds are chiefly to be found
near the flowers at which each of the species of <!-- page
45--><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>the
genus is wont to feed.&nbsp; The pie, the gallinaceous, the
columbine, and passerine tribes, resort to the fruit-bearing
trees.</p>
<p>You never fail to see the common vulture where there is
carrion.&nbsp; In passing up the river there was an opportunity
of seeing a pair of the king of the vultures; they were sitting
on the naked branch of a tree, with about a dozen of the common
ones with them.&nbsp; A tiger had killed a goat the day before;
he had been driven away in the act of sucking the blood, and not
finding it safe or prudent to return, the goat remained in the
same place where he had killed it; it had begun to putrefy, and
the vultures had arrived that morning to claim the savoury
morsel.</p>
<p>At the close of day, the vampires leave the hollow trees,
whither they had fled at the morning&rsquo;s dawn, and scour
along the river&rsquo;s banks in quest of prey.&nbsp; On waking
from sleep, the astonished traveller finds his hammock all
stained with blood.&nbsp; It is the vampire that has sucked
him.&nbsp; Not man alone, but every unprotected animal, is
exposed to his depredations; and so gently does this nocturnal
surgeon draw the blood, that instead of being roused, the patient
is lulled into a still profounder sleep.&nbsp; There are two
species of vampire in Demerara, and both suck living animals; one
is rather larger than the common bat; the other measures above
two feet from wing to wing extended.</p>
<p><!-- page 46--><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>Snakes are frequently met with in the woods betwixt the
sea-coast and the rock Saba, chiefly near the creeks and on the
banks of the river.&nbsp; They are large, beautiful, and
formidable.&nbsp; The rattlesnake seems partial to a tract of
ground known by the name of Canal Number Three; there the effects
of his poison will be long remembered.</p>
<p>The camoudi snake has been killed from thirty to forty feet
long; though not venomous, his size renders him destructive to
the passing animals.&nbsp; The Spaniards in the Oroonoque
positively affirm that he grows to the length of seventy or
eighty feet, and that he will destroy the strongest and largest
bull.&nbsp; His name seems to confirm this; there he is called
&ldquo;matatoro,&rdquo; which literally means
&ldquo;bull-killer.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus he may be ranked amongst
the deadly snakes: for it comes nearly to the same thing in the
end, whether the victim dies by poison from the fangs, which
corrupts his blood and makes it stink horribly, or whether his
body be crushed to mummy and swallowed by this hideous beast.</p>
<p>The whipsnake, of a beautiful changing green, and the coral
with alternate broad transverse bars of black and red, glide from
bush to bush, and may be handled with safety; they are harmless
little creatures.</p>
<p>The labarri snake is speckled, of a dirty brown colour, and
can scarcely be distinguished from the ground or stump on which
he is coiled up; he grows <!-- page 47--><a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>to the length
of about eight feet, and his bite often proves fatal in a few
minutes.</p>
<p>Unrivalled in his display of every lovely colour of the
rainbow, and unmatched in the effects of his deadly poison, the
counacouchi glides undaunted on, sole monarch of these forests;
he is commonly known by the name of the bush-master.&nbsp; Both
man and beast fly before him, and allow him to pursue an
undisputed path.&nbsp; He sometimes grows to the length of
fourteen feet.</p>
<p>A few small caymans, from two to twelve feet long, may be
observed now and then in passing up and down the river: they just
keep their heads above the water, and a stranger would not know
them from a rotten stump.</p>
<p>Lizards of the finest green, brown, and copper colour, from
two inches to two feet and a half long, are ever and anon
rustling among the fallen leaves, and crossing the path before
you; whilst the chameleon is busily employed in chasing insects
round the trunks of the neighbouring trees.</p>
<p>The fish are of many different sorts, and well-tasted, but
not, generally speaking, very plentiful.&nbsp; It is probable
that their numbers are considerably thinned by the otters, which
are much larger than those of Europe.&nbsp; In going through the
overflowed savannas which have all a communication with the
river, you <!-- page 48--><a name="page48"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 48</span>may often see a dozen or two of them
sporting among the sedges before you.</p>
<p>This warm and humid climate seems particularly adapted to the
producing of insects; it gives birth to myriads, beautiful past
description in their variety of tints, astonishing in their form
and size, and many of them noxious in their qualities.</p>
<p>He whose eye can distinguish the various beauties of
uncultivated nature, and whose ear is not shut to the wild sounds
in the woods, will be delighted in passing up the river
Demerara.&nbsp; Every now and then, the maam or tinamou sends
forth one long and plaintive whistle from the depths of the
forest, and then stops; whilst the yelping of the toucan, and the
shrill voice of the bird called pi-pi-yo, is heard during the
interval.&nbsp; The campanero never fails to attract the
attention of the passenger: at a distance of nearly three miles
you may hear this snow-white bird tolling every four or five
minutes, like the distant convent bell.&nbsp; From six to nine in
the morning the forests resound with the mingled cries and
strains of the feathered race; after this they gradually die
away.&nbsp; From eleven to three all nature is hushed as in a
midnight silence, and scarce a note is heard, saving that of the
campanero and the pi-pi-yo; it is then that, oppressed by the
solar heat, the birds retire to the thickest shade and wait for
the refreshing cool of evening.</p>
<p><!-- page 49--><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>At sun-down the vampires, bats, and goat-suckers dart
from their lonely retreat, and skim along the trees on the
river&rsquo;s bank.&nbsp; The different kinds of frogs almost
stun the ear with their hoarse and hollow-sounding croaking,
while the owls and goat-suckers lament and mourn all night
long.</p>
<p>About two hours before daybreak you will hear the red monkey
moaning as though in deep distress; the houtou, a solitary bird,
and only found in the thickest recesses of the forest, distinctly
articulates, &ldquo;houtou, houtou,&rdquo; in a low and plaintive
tone, an hour before sunrise; the maam whistles about the same
hour; the hannaquoi, pataca, and maroudi announce his near
approach to the eastern horizon, and the parrots and parroquets
confirm his arrival there.</p>
<p>The crickets chirp from sunset to sunrise, and often during
the day, when the weather is cloudy.&nbsp; The b&ecirc;terouge is
exceeding numerous in these extensive wilds, and not only man,
but beasts and birds, are tormented by it.&nbsp; Mosquitos are
very rare after you pass the third island in the Demerara, and
sand-flies but seldom appear.</p>
<p>Courteous reader, here thou hast the outlines of an amazing
landscape given thee; thou wilt see that the principal parts of
it are but faintly traced, some of them scarcely visible at all,
and that the shades are wholly wanting.&nbsp; If thy soul
partakes of the ardent <!-- page 50--><a name="page50"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 50</span>flame which the persevering Mungo
Park&rsquo;s did, these outlines will be enough for thee: for
they will give some idea of what a noble country this is: and if
thou hast but courage to set about giving the world a finished
picture of it, neither materials to work on, nor colours to paint
it in its true shades, will be wanting to thee.&nbsp; It may
appear a difficult task at a distance; but look close at it, and
it is nothing at all; provided thou hast but a quiet mind, little
more is necessary, and the Genius which presides over these wilds
will kindly help thee through the rest.&nbsp; She will allow thee
to slay the fawn, and to cut down the mountain-cabbage for thy
support, and to select from every part of her domain whatever may
be necessary for the work thou art about; but having killed a
pair of doves in order to enable thee to give mankind a true and
proper description of them, thou must not destroy a third through
wantonness, or to show what a good marksman thou art; that would
only blot the picture thou art finishing, not colour it.</p>
<p>Though retired from the haunts of men, and even without a
friend with thee, thou wouldst not find it solitary.&nbsp; The
crowing of the hannaquoi will sound in thine ears like the
daybreak town-clock; and the wren and the thrush will join with
thee in thy matin hymn to thy Creator, to thank Him for thy
night&rsquo;s rest.</p>
<p>At noon the Genius will lead thee to the troely, one <!-- page
51--><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>leaf
of which will defend thee from both sun and rain.&nbsp; And if,
in the cool of the evening, thou hast been tempted to stray too
far from thy place of abode, and art deprived of light to write
down the information thou hast collected, the firefly, which thou
wilt see in almost every bush around thee, will be thy
candle.&nbsp; Hold it over thy pocket-book, in any position which
thou knowest will not hurt it, and it will afford thee ample
light.&nbsp; And when thou hast done with it, put it kindly back
again on the next branch to thee.&nbsp; It will want no other
reward for its services.</p>
<p>When in thy hammock, should the thought of thy little crosses
and disappointments, in thy ups and downs through life, break in
upon thee, and throw thee into a pensive mood, the owl will bear
thee company.&nbsp; She will tell thee that hard has been her
fate too; and, at intervals, &ldquo;Whip-poor-Will&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Willy come go&rdquo; will take up the tale of
sorrow.&nbsp; Ovid has told thee how the owl once boasted the
human form, and lost it for a very small offence; and were the
poet alive now, he would inform thee that
&ldquo;Whip-poor-Will,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Willy come go,&rdquo;
are the shades of those poor African and Indian slaves, who died
worn out and broken-hearted.&nbsp; They wail and cry,
&ldquo;Whip-poor-Will,&rdquo; &ldquo;Willy come go,&rdquo; all
night long; and often when the moon shines you see them sitting
on the green turf, near the houses of those whose ancestors <!--
page 52--><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
52</span>tore them from the bosom of their helpless families,
which all probably perished through grief and want after their
support was gone.</p>
<p>About an hour above the rock of Saba stands the habitation of
an Indian, called Simon, on the top of a hill.&nbsp; The side
next the river is almost perpendicular, and you may easily throw
a stone over to the opposite bank.&nbsp; Here there was an
opportunity of seeing man in his rudest state.&nbsp; The Indians
who frequented this habitation, though living in the midst of
woods, bore evident marks of attention to their persons.&nbsp;
Their hair was neatly collected, and tied up in a knot; their
bodies fancifully painted red, and the paint was scented with
hayawa.&nbsp; This gave them a gay and animated appearance.&nbsp;
Some of them had on necklaces, composed of the teeth of wild
boars slain in the chase; many wore rings, and others had an
ornament on the left arm, midway betwixt the shoulder and the
elbow.&nbsp; At the close of day they regularly bathed in the
river below; and the next morning seemed busy in renewing the
faded colours of their faces.</p>
<p>One day there came into the hut a form which literally might
be called the wild man of the woods.&nbsp; On entering, he laid
down a ball of wax, which he had collected in the forest.&nbsp;
His hammock was all ragged and torn; and his bow, though of good
wood, was <!-- page 53--><a name="page53"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>without any ornament or polish;
&ldquo;erubuit domino, cultior esse suo.&rdquo;&nbsp; His face
was meagre, his looks forbidding, and his whole appearance
neglected.&nbsp; His long black hair hung from his head in matted
confusion; nor had his body to all appearance ever been
painted.&nbsp; They gave him some cassava bread and boiled fish,
which he ate voraciously, and soon after left the hut.&nbsp; As
he went out you could observe no traces in his countenance or
demeanour which indicated that he was in the least mindful of
having been benefited by the society he was just leaving.</p>
<p>The Indians said that he had neither wife, nor child, nor
friend.&nbsp; They had often tried to persuade him to come and
live amongst them; but all was of no avail.&nbsp; He went roving
on, plundering the wild bees of their honey, and picking up the
fallen nuts and fruits of the forest.&nbsp; When he fell in with
game, he procured fire from two sticks, and cooked it on the
spot.&nbsp; When a hut happened to be in his way, he stepped in
and asked for something to eat, and then months elapsed ere they
saw him again.&nbsp; They did not know what had caused him to be
thus unsettled; he had been so for years; nor did they believe
that even old age itself would change the habits of this poor,
harmless, solitary wanderer.</p>
<p>From Simon&rsquo;s, the traveller may reach the large fall
with ease in four days.</p>
<p><!-- page 54--><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
54</span>The first falls that he meets are merely rapids, scarce
a stone appearing above the water in the rainy season; and those
in the bed of the river barely high enough to arrest the
water&rsquo;s course, and by causing a bubbling, show that they
are there.</p>
<p>With this small change of appearance in the stream, the
stranger observes nothing new till he comes within eight or ten
miles of the great fall.&nbsp; Each side of the river presents an
uninterrupted range of wood, just as it did below.&nbsp; All the
productions found betwixt the plantations and the rock Saba are
to be met with here.</p>
<p>From Simon&rsquo;s to the great fall there are five
habitations of the Indians&mdash;two of them close to the
river&rsquo;s side; the other three a little way in the
forest.&nbsp; These habitations consist of from four to eight
huts, situated on about an acre of ground which they have cleared
from the surrounding woods.&nbsp; A few pappaw, cotton, and
mountain cabbage-trees are scattered round them.</p>
<p>At one of these habitations a small quantity of the
wourali-poison was procured.&nbsp; It was in a little
gourd.&nbsp; The Indian who had it said that he had killed a
number of wild hogs with it and two tapirs.&nbsp; Appearances
seemed to confirm what he had said; for on one side it had been
nearly taken out to the bottom at different times, which probably
would not have been the case had the first or second trial
failed.</p>
<p><!-- page 55--><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>Its strength was proved on a middle-sized dog.&nbsp; He
was wounded in the thigh, in order that there might be no
possibility of touching a vital part.&nbsp; In three or four
minutes he began to be affected, smelt at every little thing on
the ground around him, and looked wistfully at the wounded
part.&nbsp; Soon after this he staggered, laid himself down, and
never rose more.&nbsp; He barked once, though not as if in
pain.&nbsp; His voice was low and weak; and in a second attempt
it quite failed him.&nbsp; He now put his head betwixt his
fore-legs, and raising it slowly again, he fell over on his
side.&nbsp; His eyes immediately became fixed, and though his
extremities every now and then shot convulsively, he never showed
the least desire to raise up his head.&nbsp; His heart fluttered
much from the time he lay down, and at intervals beat very
strong; then stopped for a moment or two, and then beat again;
and continued faintly beating several minutes after every other
part of his body seemed dead.</p>
<p>In a quarter of an hour after he had received the poison he
was quite motionless.</p>
<p>A few miles before you reach the great fall, and which,
indeed, is the only one which can be called a fall, large balls
of froth come floating past you.&nbsp; The river appears
beautifully marked with streaks of foam, and on your nearer
approach the stream is whitened all over.</p>
<p>At first, you behold the fall rushing down a bed of <!-- page
56--><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>rocks, with a tremendous noise, divided into two foamy
streams, which at their junction again form a small island
covered with wood.&nbsp; Above this island, for a short space,
there appears but one stream all white with froth, and fretting
and boiling amongst the huge rocks which obstruct its course.</p>
<p>Higher up it is seen dividing itself into a short channel or
two, and trees grow on the rocks which caused its
separation.&nbsp; The torrent in many places has eaten deep into
the rocks, and split them into large fragments by driving others
against them.&nbsp; The trees on the rocks are in bloom and
vigour, though their roots are half bared, and many of them
bruised and broken by the rushing waters.</p>
<p>This is the general appearance of the fall from the level of
the water below to where the river is smooth and quiet
above.&nbsp; It must be remembered that this is during the
periodical rains.&nbsp; Probably in the dry season it puts on a
very different appearance.&nbsp; There is no perpendicular fall
of water of any consequence throughout it, but the dreadful
roaring and rushing of the torrent down a long, rocky, and
moderately sloping channel has a fine effect; and the stranger
returns well pleased with what he has seen.&nbsp; No animal, nor
craft of any kind, could stem this downward flood.&nbsp; In a few
moments the first would be killed, the second dashed in
pieces.</p>
<p><!-- page 57--><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
57</span>The Indians have a path alongside of it, through the
forest, where prodigious crabwood trees grow.&nbsp; Up this path
they drag their canoes, and launch them into the river above; and
on their return bring them down the same way.</p>
<p>About two hours below this fall is the habitation of an Acoway
chief called Sinkerman.&nbsp; At night you hear the roaring of
the fall from it.&nbsp; It is pleasantly situated on the top of a
sand-hill.&nbsp; At this place you have the finest view the river
Demerara affords: three tiers of hills rise in slow gradation,
one above the other before you, and present a grand and
magnificent scene, especially to him who has been accustomed to a
level country.</p>
<p>Here, a little after midnight on the first of May, was heard a
most strange and unaccountable noise; it seemed as though several
regiments were engaged, and musketry firing with great
rapidity.&nbsp; The Indians, terrified beyond description, left
their hammocks and crowded all together, like sheep at the
approach of the wolf.&nbsp; There were no soldiers within three
or four hundred miles.&nbsp; Conjecture was of no avail, and all
conversation next morning on the subject was as useless and
unsatisfactory as the dead silence which succeeded to the
noise.</p>
<p>He who wishes to reach the Macoushi country had better send
his canoe over land from Sinkerman&rsquo;s to the Essequibo.</p>
<p><!-- page 58--><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
58</span>There is a pretty good path, and meeting a creek about
three-quarters of the way, it eases the labour, and twelve
Indians will arrive with it in the Essequibo in four days.</p>
<p>The traveller need not attend his canoe; there is a shorter
and a better way.&nbsp; Half an hour below Sinkerman&rsquo;s he
finds a little creek on the western bank of the Demerara.&nbsp;
After proceeding about a couple of hundred yards up it, he leaves
it, and pursues a west-north-west direction by land for the
Essequibo.&nbsp; The path is good, though somewhat rugged with
the roots of trees, and here and there obstructed by fallen ones;
it extends more over level ground than otherwise.&nbsp; There are
a few steep ascents and descents in it, with a little brook
running at the bottom of them; but they are easily passed over,
and the fallen trees serve for a bridge.</p>
<p>You may reach the Essequibo with ease in a day and a half; and
so matted and interwoven are the tops of the trees above you,
that the sun is not felt once all the way, saving where the space
which a newly-fallen tree occupied lets in his rays upon
you.&nbsp; The forest contains an abundance of wild hogs, lobbas,
acouries, powisses, maams, maroudis, and waracabas for your
nourishment, and there are plenty of leaves to cover a shed
whenever you are inclined to sleep.</p>
<p>The soil has three-fourths of sand in it, till you come <!--
page 59--><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span>within half an hour&rsquo;s walk of the Essequibo, where
you find a red gravel and rocks.&nbsp; In this retired and
solitary tract, nature&rsquo;s garb, to all appearance, has not
been injured by fire, nor her productions broken in upon by the
exterminating hand of man.</p>
<p>Here the finest green-heart grows, and wallaba, purple-heart,
siloabali, sawari, buletre, tauronira, and mora, are met with in
vast abundance, far and near, towering up in majestic grandeur,
straight as pillars sixty or seventy feet high, without a knot,
or branch.</p>
<p>Traveller, forget for a little while the idea thou hast of
wandering farther on, and stop and look at this grand picture of
vegetable nature; it is a reflection of the crowd thou hast
lately been in, and though a silent monitor, it is not a less
eloquent one on that account.&nbsp; See that noble purple-heart
before thee!&nbsp; Nature has been kind to it.&nbsp; Not a hole,
not the least oozing from its trunk, to show that its best days
are past.&nbsp; Vigorous in youthful blooming beauty, it stands
the ornament of these sequestered wilds, and tacitly rebukes
those base ones of thine own species who have been hardy enough
to deny the existence of Him who ordered it to flourish
there.</p>
<p>Behold that one next to it!&mdash;Hark! how the hammerings of
the red-headed woodpecker resound through its distempered
boughs!&nbsp; See what a quantity of holes he has made in it, and
how its bark is stained <!-- page 60--><a name="page60"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 60</span>with the drops which trickle down
from them.&nbsp; The lightning, too, has blasted one side of
it.&nbsp; Nature looks pale and wan in its leaves, and her
resources are nearly dried up in its extremities; its sap is
tainted; a mortal sickness, slow as a consumption, and as sure in
its consequences, has long since entered its frame, vitiating and
destroying the wholesome juices there.</p>
<p>Step a few paces aside, and cast thine eye on that remnant of
a mora behind it.&nbsp; Best part of its branches, once so high
and ornamental, now lie on the ground in sad confusion one upon
the other, all shattered and fungus-grown, and a prey to millions
of insects, which are busily employed in destroying them.&nbsp;
One branch of it still looks healthy!&nbsp; Will it
recover?&nbsp; No, it cannot; nature has already run her course,
and that healthy looking branch is only as a fallacious good
symptom in him who is just about to die of a mortification when
he feels no more pain, and fancies his distemper has left him; it
is as the momentary gleam of a wintry sun&rsquo;s ray close to
the western horizon.&mdash;See! while we are speaking, a gust of
wind has brought the tree to the ground, and made room for its
successor.</p>
<p>Come farther on, and examine that apparently luxuriant
tauronira on thy right hand.&nbsp; It boasts a verdure not its
own; they are false ornaments it wears; the bush-rope and
bird-vines have clothed it from the root to its topmost
branch.&nbsp; The succession of fruit <!-- page 61--><a
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>which it hath
borne, like good cheer in the houses of the great, has invited
the birds to resort to it, and they have disseminated beautiful,
though destructive, plants on its branches, which, like the
distempers vice brings into the human frame, rob it of all its
health and vigour; they have shortened its days, and probably in
another year they will finally kill it, long before nature
intended that it should die.</p>
<p>Ere thou leavest this interesting scene, look on the ground
around thee, and see what everything here below must come to.</p>
<p>Behold that newly fallen wallaba!&nbsp; The whirlwind has
uprooted it in its prime, and it has brought down to the ground a
dozen small ones in its fall.&nbsp; Its bark has already begun to
drop off!&nbsp; And that heart of mora close by it is fast
yielding, in spite of its firm, tough texture.</p>
<p>The tree which thou passedst but a little ago, and which
perhaps has lain over yonder brook for years, can now hardly
support itself, and in a few months more it will have fallen into
the water.</p>
<p>Put thy foot on that large trunk thou seest to the left.&nbsp;
It seems entire amid the surrounding fragments.&nbsp; Mere
outward appearance, delusive phantom of what it once was!&nbsp;
Tread on it, and like the fuss-ball, it will break into dust.</p>
<p>Sad and silent mementoes to the giddy traveller as <!-- page
62--><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>he
wanders on!&nbsp; Prostrate remnants of vegetable nature, how
incontestably ye prove what we must all at last come to, and how
plain your mouldering ruins show that the firmest texture avails
us nought when Heaven wills that we should cease to
be!&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The cloud-capp&rsquo;d towers, the gorgeous
palaces,<br />
The solemn temples, the great globe itself,<br />
Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve,<br />
And, like the baseless fabric of a vision,<br />
Leave not a rack behind.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cast thine eye around thee, and see the thousands of
nature&rsquo;s productions.&nbsp; Take a view of them from the
opening seed on the surface, sending a downward shoot, to the
loftiest and the largest trees, rising up and blooming in wild
luxuriance; some side by side, others separate; some curved and
knotty, others straight as lances, all in beautiful gradation,
fulfilling the mandates they had received from Heaven, and though
condemned to die, still never failing to keep up their species
till time shall be no more.</p>
<p>Reader, must thou not be induced to dedicate a few months to
the good of the public, and examine with thy scientific eye the
productions which the vast and well-stored colony of Demerara
presents to thee?</p>
<p>What an immense range of forest is there from the rock Saba to
the great fall! and what an uninterrupted extent before thee from
it to the banks of the <!-- page 63--><a name="page63"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 63</span>Essequibo!&nbsp; No doubt, there is
many a balsam and many a medicinal root yet to be discovered, and
many a resin, gum, and oil yet unnoticed.&nbsp; Thy work would be
a pleasing one, and thou mightest make several useful
observations in it.</p>
<p>Would it be thought impertinent in thee to hazard a
conjecture, that, with the resources the Government of Demerara
has, stones might be conveyed from the rock Saba to Stabroek to
stem the equinoctial tides, which are for ever sweeping away the
expensive wooden piles around the mounds of the fort?&nbsp; Or
would the timber-merchant point at thee in passing by, and call
thee a descendant of La Mancha&rsquo;s knight, because thou
maintainest that the stones which form the rapids might be
removed with little expense, and thus open the navigation to the
woodcutter from Stabroek to the great fall?&nbsp; Or wouldst thou
be deemed enthusiastic or biassed, because thou givest it as thy
opinion that the climate in these high lands is exceedingly
wholesome, and the lands themselves capable of nourishing and
maintaining any number of settlers?&nbsp; In thy dissertation on
the Indians, thou mightest hint, that possibly they could be
induced to help the new settlers a little; and that, finding
their labours well requited, it would be the means of their
keeping up a constant communication with us, which probably might
he the means of laying the first stone towards their
Christianity.&nbsp; They are <!-- page 64--><a
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>a poor,
harmless, inoffensive set of people, and their wanderings and
ill-provided way of living seem more to ask for pity from us,
than to fill our heads with thoughts that they would be hostile
to us.</p>
<p>What a noble field, kind reader, for thy experimental
philosophy and speculations, for thy learning, for thy
perseverance, for thy kind-heartedness, for everything that is
great and good within thee!</p>
<p>The accidental traveller who has journeyed on from Stabroek to
the rock Saba, and from thence to the banks of the Essequibo, in
pursuit of other things, as he told thee at the beginning, with
but an indifferent interpreter to talk to, no friend to converse
with, and totally unfit for that which he wishes thee to do, can
merely mark the outlines of the path he has trodden, or tell thee
the sounds he has heard, or faintly describe what he has seen in
the environs of his resting-places; but if this be enough to
induce thee to undertake the journey, and give the world a
description of it, he will be amply satisfied.</p>
<p>It will be two days and a half from the time of entering the
path on the western bank of the Demerara till all be ready, and
the canoe fairly afloat on the Essequibo.&nbsp; The new rigging
it, and putting every little thing to rights and in its proper
place, cannot well be done in less than a day.</p>
<p>After being night and day in the forest <!-- page 65--><a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>impervious to
the sun and moon&rsquo;s rays, the sudden transition to light has
a fine heart-cheering effect.&nbsp; Welcome as a lost friend, the
solar beam makes the frame rejoice, and with it a thousand
enlivening thoughts rush at once on the soul, and disperse, as a
vapour, every sad and sorrowful idea, which the deep gloom had
helped to collect there.&nbsp; In coming out of the woods, you
see the western bank of the Essequibo before you, low and
flat.&nbsp; Here the river is two-thirds as broad as the Demerara
at Stabroek.</p>
<p>To the northward there is a hill higher than any in the
Demerara; and in the south-south-west quarter a mountain.&nbsp;
It is far away, and appears like a bluish cloud in the
horizon.&nbsp; There is not the least opening on either
side.&nbsp; Hills, valleys, and lowlands, are all linked together
by a chain of forest.&nbsp; Ascend the highest mountain, climb
the loftiest tree, as far as the eye can extend, whichever way it
directs itself, all is luxuriant and unbroken forest.</p>
<p>In about nine or ten hours from this, you get to an Indian
habitation of three huts, on the point of an island.&nbsp; It is
said that a Dutch post once stood here; but there is not the
smallest vestige of it remaining, and, except that the trees
appear younger than those on the other islands, which shows that
the place has been cleared some time or other, there is no mark
left by which you can conjecture that ever this was a post.</p>
<p><!-- page 66--><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>The many islands which you meet with in the way, enliven
and change the scene, by the avenues which they make, which look
like the mouths of other rivers, and break that long-extended
sameness which is seen in the Demerara.</p>
<p>Proceeding onwards, you get to the falls and rapids.&nbsp; In
the rainy season they are very tedious to pass, and often stop
your course.&nbsp; In the dry season, by stepping from rock to
rock, the Indians soon manage to get a canoe over them.&nbsp; But
when the river is swollen, as it was in May, 1812, it is then a
difficult task, and often a dangerous one too.&nbsp; At that time
many of the islands were overflowed, the rocks covered, and the
lower branches of the trees in the water.&nbsp; Sometimes the
Indians were obliged to take everything out of the canoe, cut a
passage through the branches, which hung over into the river, and
then drag up the canoe by main force.</p>
<p>At one place, the falls form an oblique line quite across the
river, impassable to the ascending canoe, and you are forced to
have it dragged four or five hundred yards by land.</p>
<p>It will take you five days, from the Indian habitation on the
point of the island, to where these falls and rapids
terminate.</p>
<p>There are no huts in the way.&nbsp; You must bring your own
cassava-bread along with you, hunt in the forest <!-- page
67--><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>for
your meat, and make the night&rsquo;s shelter for yourself.</p>
<p>Here is a noble range of hills, all covered with the finest
trees, rising majestically one above the other, on the western
bank, and presenting as rich a scene as ever the eye would wish
to look on.&nbsp; Nothing in vegetable nature can be conceived
more charming, grand, and luxuriant.</p>
<p>How the heart rejoices in viewing this beautiful landscape!
when the sky is serene, the air cool, and the sun just sunk
behind the mountain&rsquo;s top.</p>
<p>The hayawa-tree perfumes the woods around; pairs of scarlet
aras are continually crossing the river.&nbsp; The maam sends
forth its plaintive note, the wren chants its evening song.&nbsp;
The caprimulgus wheels in busy flight around the canoe, while
&ldquo;whip-poor-will&rdquo; sits on the broken stump near the
water&rsquo;s edge, complaining as the shades of night set
in.</p>
<p>A little before you pass the last of these rapids two immense
rocks appear, nearly on the summit of one of the many hills which
form this far-extending range where it begins to fall off
gradually to the south.</p>
<p>They look like two ancient stately towers of some Gothic
potentate, rearing their heads above the surrounding trees.&nbsp;
What with their situation and their shape together, they strike
the beholder with an idea of antiquated grandeur which he will
never forget.&nbsp; <!-- page 68--><a name="page68"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 68</span>He may travel far and near and see
nothing like them.&nbsp; On looking at them through a glass, the
summit of the southern one appeared crowned with bushes.&nbsp;
The one to the north was quite bare.&nbsp; The Indians have it
from their ancestors that they are the abode of an evil genius,
and they pass in the river below with a reverential awe.</p>
<p>In about seven hours from these stupendous sons of the hill,
you leave the Essequibo, and enter the river Apourapoura, which
falls into it from the south.&nbsp; The Apourapoura is nearly
one-third the size of the Demerara at Stabroek.&nbsp; For two
days you see nothing but level ground, richly clothed in
timber.&nbsp; You leave the Siparouni to the right hand, and on
the third day come to a little hill.&nbsp; The Indians have
cleared about an acre of ground on it, and erected a temporary
shed.&nbsp; If it be not intended for provision-ground alone,
perhaps the next white man who travels through these remote wilds
will find an Indian settlement here.</p>
<p>Two days after leaving this, you get to a rising ground on the
western bank, where stands a single hut; and about half a mile in
the forest there are a few more; some of them square, and some
round with spiral roofs.</p>
<p>Here the fish called pacou is very plentiful: it is perhaps
the fattest and most delicious fish in Guiana.&nbsp; It does not
take the hook, but the Indians decoy it to <!-- page 69--><a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>the surface
of the water by means of the seeds of the crabwood-tree, and then
shoot it with an arrow.</p>
<p>You are now within the borders of Macoushia, inhabited by a
different tribe of people, called Macoushi Indians; uncommonly
dexterous in the use of the blowpipe, and famous for their skill
in preparing the deadly vegetable poison commonly called
wourali.</p>
<p>It is from this country that those beautiful paroquets named
kessi-kessi are procured.&nbsp; Here the crystal mountains are
found; and here the three different species of the ara are seen
in great abundance.&nbsp; Here, too, grows the tree from which
the gum-elastic is got; it is large, and as tall as any in the
forest.&nbsp; The wood has much the appearance of sycamore.&nbsp;
The gum is contained in the bark: when that is cut through it
oozes out very freely: it is quite white, and looks as rich as
cream: it hardens almost immediately as it issues from the tree;
so that it is very easy to collect a ball, by forming the juice
into a globular shape as fast as it comes out; it becomes nearly
black by being exposed to the air, and is real Indian rubber
without undergoing any other process.</p>
<p>The elegant crested bird called cock of the rock, admirably
described by Buffon, is a native of the woody mountains of
Macoushia.&nbsp; In the daytime he retires amongst the darkest
rocks, and only comes out to feed a little before sunrise, and at
sunset; he is of <!-- page 70--><a name="page70"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 70</span>a gloomy disposition, and, like the
houtou, never associates with the other birds of the forest.</p>
<p>The Indians in the just-mentioned settlement seemed to depend
more on the wourali-poison for killing their game than upon
anything else.&nbsp; They had only one gun, and it appeared rusty
and neglected; but their poisoned weapons were in fine
order.&nbsp; Their blowpipes hung from the roof of the hut,
carefully suspended by a silk-grass cord; and on taking a nearer
view of them, no dust seemed to have collected there, nor had the
spider spun the smallest web on them; which showed that they were
in constant use.&nbsp; The quivers were close by them, with the
jaw-bone of the fish pirai tied by a string to their brim, and a
small wicker-basket of wild cotton, which hung down to the
centre; they were nearly full of poisoned arrows.&nbsp; It was
with difficulty these Indians could be persuaded to part with any
of the wourali-poison, though a good price was offered for it;
they gave me to understand that it was powder and shot to them,
and very difficult to be procured.</p>
<p>On the second day after leaving the settlement, in passing
along, the Indians show you a place where once a white man
lived.&nbsp; His retiring so far from those of his own colour and
acquaintance seemed to carry something extraordinary along with
it, and raised a desire to know what could have induced him <!--
page 71--><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
71</span>to do so.&nbsp; It seems he had been unsuccessful, and
that his creditors had treated him with as little mercy as the
strong generally show to the weak.&nbsp; Seeing his endeavours
daily frustrated, and his best intentions of no avail, and
fearing that when they had taken all he had they would probably
take his liberty too, he thought the world would not be
hard-hearted enough to condemn him for retiring from the evils
which pressed so heavily on him, and which he had done all that
an honest man could do to ward off.&nbsp; He left his creditors
to talk of him as they thought fit, and bidding adieu for ever to
the place in which he had once seen better times, he penetrated
thus far into those remote and gloomy wilds, and ended his days
here.</p>
<p>According to the new map of South America, Lake Parima, or the
White Sea, ought to be within three or four days&rsquo; walk from
this place.&nbsp; On asking the Indians whether there was such a
place or not, and describing that the water was fresh and good to
drink, an old Indian, who appeared to be about sixty, said that
there was such a place, and that he had been there.&nbsp; This
information would have been satisfactory in some degree, had not
the Indians carried the point a little too far.&nbsp; It is very
large, said another Indian, and ships come to it.&nbsp; Now these
unfortunate ships were the very things which were not wanted; had
he <!-- page 72--><a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
72</span>kept them out, it might have done, but his introducing
them was sadly against the lake.&nbsp; Thus you must either
suppose that the old savage and his companion had a confused idea
of the thing, and that probably the Lake Parima they talked of
was the Amazons, not far from the city of Para, or that it was
their intention to deceive you.&nbsp; You ought to be cautious in
giving credit to their stories, otherwise you will be apt to be
led astray.</p>
<p>Many a ridiculous thing concerning the interior of Guiana has
been propagated and received as true, merely because six or seven
Indians, questioned separately, have agreed in their
narrative.</p>
<p>Ask those who live high up in the Demerara, and they will,
every one of them, tell you that there is a nation of Indians
with long tails; that they are very malicious, cruel and
ill-natured; and that the Portuguese have been obliged to stop
them off in a certain river, to prevent their depredations.&nbsp;
They have also dreadful stories concerning a horrible beast,
called the watermamma, which, when it happens to take a spite
against a canoe, rises out of the river, and in the most
unrelenting manner possible carries both canoe and Indians down
to the bottom with it, and there destroys them.&nbsp; Ludicrous
extravagances; pleasing to those fond of the marvellous, and
excellent matter for a distempered brain.</p>
<p><!-- page 73--><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>The misinformed and timid court of policy in Demerara
was made the dupe of a savage, who came down the Essequibo, and
gave himself out as king of a mighty tribe.&nbsp; This naked wild
man of the woods seemed to hold the said court in tolerable
contempt, and demanded immense supplies, all which he got; and
moreover, some time after, an invitation to come down the ensuing
year for more, which he took care not to forget.</p>
<p>This noisy chieftain boasted so much of his dynasty and
domain, that the Government was induced to send up an expedition
into his territories to see if he had spoken the truth, and
nothing but the truth.&nbsp; It appeared, however, that his
palace was nothing but a hut, the monarch a needy savage, the
heir-apparent nothing to inherit but his father&rsquo;s club and
bow and arrows, and his officers of state wild and uncultivated
as the forests through which they strayed.</p>
<p>There was nothing in the hut of this savage, saving the
presents he had received from Government, but what was barely
sufficient to support existence; nothing that indicated a power
to collect a hostile force; nothing that showed the least
progress towards civilisation.&nbsp; All was rude and barbarous
in the extreme, expressive of the utmost poverty and a scanty
population.</p>
<p>You may travel six or seven days without seeing a <!-- page
74--><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>hut,
and when you reach a settlement it seldom contains more than
ten.</p>
<p>The further you advance into the interior the more you are
convinced that it is thinly inhabited.</p>
<p>The day after passing the place where the white man lived you
see a creek on the left hand, and shortly after the path to the
open country.&nbsp; Here you drag the canoe up into the forest,
and leave it there.&nbsp; Your baggage must now be carried by the
Indians.&nbsp; The creek you passed in the river intersects the
path to the next settlement: a large mora has fallen across it,
and makes an excellent bridge.&nbsp; After walking an hour and a
half you come to the edge of the forest, and a savanna unfolds
itself to the view.</p>
<p>The finest park that England boasts falls far short of this
delightful scene.&nbsp; There are about two thousand acres of
grass, with here and there a clump of trees, and a few bushes and
single trees scattered up and down by the hand of Nature.&nbsp;
The ground is neither hilly nor level, but diversified with
moderate rises and falls, so gently running into one another that
the eye cannot distinguish where they begin, nor where they end,
while the distant black rocks have the appearance of a herd at
rest.&nbsp; Nearly in the middle there is an eminence, which
falls off gradually on every side; and on this the Indians have
erected their huts.</p>
<p><!-- page 75--><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
75</span>To the northward of them the forest forms a circle, as
though it had been done by art; to the eastward it hangs in
festoons; and to the south and west it rushes in abruptly,
disclosing a new scene behind it at every step as you advance
along.</p>
<p>This beautiful park of nature is quite surrounded by lofty
hills, all arrayed in superbest garb of trees; some in the form
of pyramids, others like sugar-loaves towering one above the
other; some rounded off, and others as though they had lost their
apex.&nbsp; Here two hills rise up in spiral summits, and the
wooded line of communication betwixt them sinks so gradually that
it forms a crescent; and there the ridges of others resemble the
waves of an agitated sea.&nbsp; Beyond these appear others, and
others past them; and others still farther on, till they can
scarcely be distinguished from the clouds.</p>
<p>There are no sand-flies, nor b&ecirc;te-rouge, nor mosquitos
in this pretty spot.&nbsp; The fire-flies during the night vie in
numbers and brightness with the stars in the firmament above: the
air is pure, and the north-east breeze blows a refreshing gale
throughout the day.&nbsp; Here the white-crested maroudi, which
is never found in the Demerara, is pretty plentiful; and here
grows the tree which produces the moran, sometimes called balsam
capivi.</p>
<p>Your route lies south from this place; and at the <!-- page
76--><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
76</span>extremity of the savanna you enter the forest, and
journey along a winding path at the foot of a hill.&nbsp; There
is no habitation within this day&rsquo;s walk.&nbsp; The
traveller, as usual, must sleep in the forest.&nbsp; The path is
not so good the following day.&nbsp; The hills over which it lies
are rocky, steep, and rugged, and the spaces betwixt them swampy,
and mostly knee-deep in water.&nbsp; After eight hours&rsquo;
walk you find two or three Indian huts, surrounded by the forest;
and in little more than half an hour from these you come to ten
or twelve others, where you pass the night.&nbsp; They are
prettily situated at the entrance into a savanna.&nbsp; The
eastern and western hills are still covered with wood; but on
looking to the south-west quarter you perceive it begins to die
away.&nbsp; In those forests you may find plenty of the trees
which yield the sweet-smelling resin called acaiari, and which,
when pounded and burnt on charcoal, gives a delightful
fragrance.</p>
<p>From hence you proceed, in a south-west direction, through a
long swampy savanna.&nbsp; Some of the hills which border on it
have nothing but a thin coarse grass and huge stones on them;
others, quite wooded; others with their summits crowned, and
their base quite bare; and others, again, with their summits
bare, and their base in thickest wood.</p>
<p>Half of this day&rsquo;s march is in water, nearly up to the
knees.&nbsp; There are four creeks to pass; one of <!-- page
77--><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>them
has a fallen tree across it.&nbsp; You must make your own bridge
across the other three.&nbsp; Probably, were the truth known,
these apparently four creeks are only the meanders of one.</p>
<p>The jabiru, the largest bird in Guiana, feeds in the marshy
savanna through which you have just passed.&nbsp; He is wary and
shy, and will not allow you to get within gun-shot of him.</p>
<p>You sleep this night in the forest, and reach an Indian
settlement about three o&rsquo;clock the next evening, after
walking one-third of the way through wet and miry ground.</p>
<p>But, bad as the walking is through it, it is easier than where
you cross over the bare hills, where you have to tread on sharp
stones, most of them lying edgewise.</p>
<p>The ground gone over these two last days seems condemned to
perpetual solitude and silence.&nbsp; There was not one
four-footed animal to be seen, nor even the marks of one.&nbsp;
It would have been as silent as midnight, and all as still and
unmoved as a monument had not the jabiru in the marsh, and a few
vultures soaring over the mountain&rsquo;s top, shown that it was
not quite deserted by animated nature.&nbsp; There were no
insects, except one kind of fly about one-fourth the size of the
common house-fly.&nbsp; It bit cruelly, and was much more
tormenting than the mosquito on the sea-coast.</p>
<p>This seems to be the native country of the <!-- page 78--><a
name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>arrowroot.&nbsp; Wherever you passed through a patch of
wood in a low situation, there you found it growing
luxuriantly.</p>
<p>The Indian place you are now at is not the proper place to
have come to in order to reach the Portuguese frontiers.&nbsp;
You have advanced too much to the westward.&nbsp; But there was
no alternative.&nbsp; The ground twixt you and another small
settlement (which was the right place to have gone to) was
overflowed; and thus, instead of proceeding southward, you were
obliged to wind along the foot of the western hills, quite out of
your way.</p>
<p>But the grand landscape this place affords makes you ample
amends for the time you have spent in reaching it.&nbsp; It would
require great descriptive powers to give a proper idea of the
situation these people have chosen for their dwelling.</p>
<p>The hill they are on is steep and high, and full of immense
rocks.&nbsp; The huts are not all in one place, but dispersed
wherever they have found a place level enough for a
lodgment.&nbsp; Before you ascend the hill you see at intervals
an acre or two of wood, then an open space, with a few huts on
it, then wood again, and then an open space, and so on, till the
intervening of the western hills, higher and steeper still, and
crowded with trees of the loveliest shades, closes the enchanting
scene.</p>
<p><!-- page 79--><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
79</span>At the base of this hill stretches an immense plain,
which appears to the eye, on this elevated spot, as level as a
bowling-green.&nbsp; The mountains on the other side are piled
one upon the other in romantic forms, and gradually retire, till
they are indiscernible from the clouds in which they are
involved.&nbsp; To the south-south-west this far-extending plain
is lost in the horizon.&nbsp; The trees on it, which look like
islands on the ocean, add greatly to the beauty of the landscape;
while the rivulet&rsquo;s course is marked out by the
&aelig;ta-trees which follow its meanders.</p>
<p>Not being able to pursue the direct course from hence to the
next Indian habitation on account of the floods of water which
fall at this time of the year, you take a circuit westerly along
the mountain&rsquo;s foot.</p>
<p>At last a large and deep creek stops your progress: it is wide
and rapid, and its banks very steep.&nbsp; There is neither
curial nor canoe, nor purple-heart tree in the neighbourhood to
make a wood-skin to carry you over, so that you are obliged to
swim across; and by the time you have formed a kind of raft,
composed of boughs of trees and coarse grass, to ferry over your
luggage, the day will be too far spent to think of
proceeding.&nbsp; You must be very cautious before you venture to
swim across this creek, for the alligators are numerous, and near
twenty feet long.&nbsp; On the present occasion the Indians took
uncommon <!-- page 80--><a name="page80"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 80</span>precautions lest they should be
devoured by this cruel and voracious reptile.&nbsp; They cut long
sticks, and examined closely the side of the creek for half a
mile above and below the place where it was to be crossed; and as
soon as the boldest had swum over, he did the same on the other
side, and then all followed.</p>
<p>After passing the night on the opposite bank, which is well
wooded, it is a brisk walk of nine hours before you reach four
Indian huts, on a rising ground a few hundred paces from a little
brook, whose banks are covered over with coucourito and &aelig;ta
trees.</p>
<p>This is the place you ought to have come to two days ago had
the water permitted you.&nbsp; In crossing the plain at the most
advantageous place you are above ankle-deep in water for three
hours; the remainder of the way is dry, the ground gently
rising.&nbsp; As the lower parts of this spacious plain put on
somewhat the appearance of a lake during the periodical rains, it
is not improbable but that this is the place which hath given
rise to the supposed existence of the famed Lake Parima, or El
Dorado; but this is mere conjecture.</p>
<p>A few deer are feeding on the coarse rough grass of this
far-extending plain; they keep at a distance from you, and are
continually on the look-out.</p>
<p>The spur-winged plover, and a species of the curlew, black,
with a white bar across the wings, <!-- page 81--><a
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>nearly as
large again as the scarlet curlew on the sea-coast, frequently
rise before you.&nbsp; Here, too, the Moscovy duck is numerous;
and large flocks of two other kinds wheel round you as you pass
on, but keep out of gun-shot.&nbsp; The milk-white egrets, and
jabirus, are distinguished at a great distance; and in the
&aelig;ta and coucourito trees you may observe flocks of scarlet
and blue aras feeding on the seeds.</p>
<p>It is to these trees that the largest sort of toucan
resorts.&nbsp; He is remarkable by a large black spot on the
point of his fine yellow bill.&nbsp; He is very scarce in
Demerara, and never seen except near the sea-coast.</p>
<p>The ants&rsquo; nests have a singular appearance on this
plain.&nbsp; They are in vast abundance on those parts of it free
from water, and are formed of an exceeding hard yellow
clay.&nbsp; They rise eight or ten feet from the ground in a
spiral form, impenetrable to the rain, and strong enough to defy
the severest tornado.</p>
<p>The wourali-poison, procured in these last-mentioned huts,
seemed very good, and proved afterwards to be very strong.</p>
<p>There are now no more Indian settlements betwixt you and the
Portuguese frontiers.&nbsp; If you wish to visit their fort, it
would be advisable to send an Indian with a letter from hence,
and wait his return.&nbsp; On the present occasion a very
fortunate circumstance occurred.&nbsp; The Portuguese commander
had sent some <!-- page 82--><a name="page82"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 82</span>Indians and soldiers to build a
canoe, not far from this settlement; they had just finished it,
and those who did not stay with it had stopped here on their
return.</p>
<p>The soldier who commanded the rest, said he durst not, upon
any account, convoy a stranger to the fort; but he added, as
there were two canoes, one of them might be despatched with a
letter, and then we could proceed slowly on in the other.</p>
<p>About three hours from this settlement there is a river called
Pirarara; and here the soldiers had left their canoes while they
were making the new one.&nbsp; From the Pirarara you get into the
river Maou, and then into the Tacatou; and just where the Tacatou
falls into the Rio Branco, there stands the Portuguese frontier
fort, called Fort St. Joachim.&nbsp; From the time of embarking
in the river Pirarara, it takes you four days before you reach
this fort.</p>
<p>There was nothing very remarkable in passing down these
rivers.&nbsp; It is an open country, producing a coarse grass,
and interspersed with clumps of trees.&nbsp; The banks have some
wood on them, but it appears stunted and crooked, like that on
the bleak hills in England.</p>
<p>The tapir frequently plunged into the river; he was by no
means shy, and it was easy to get a shot at him on land.&nbsp;
The kessi-kessi paroquets were in <!-- page 83--><a
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>great
abundance; and the fine scarlet ara innumerable in the coucourito
trees at a distance from the river&rsquo;s bank.&nbsp; In the
Tacatou was seen the troupiale.&nbsp; It was charming to hear the
sweet and plaintive notes of this pretty songster of the
wilds.&nbsp; The Portuguese call it the nightingale of
Guiana.</p>
<p>Towards the close of the fourth evening, the canoe, which had
been sent on with a letter, met us with the commander&rsquo;s
answer.&nbsp; During its absence, the nights had been cold and
stormy, the rain had fallen in torrents, the days cloudy, and
there was no sun to dry the wet hammocks.&nbsp; Exposed thus, day
and night, to the chilling blast and pelting shower, strength of
constitution at last failed, and a severe fever came on.&nbsp;
The commander&rsquo;s answer was very polite.&nbsp; He remarked,
he regretted much to say that he had received orders to allow no
stranger to enter the frontier, and this being the case, he hoped
I would not consider him as uncivil.&nbsp; &ldquo;However,&rdquo;
continued he, &ldquo;I have ordered the soldier to land you at a
certain distance from the fort, where we can consult
together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We had now arrived at the place, and the canoe which brought
the letter returned to the fort, to tell the commander I had
fallen sick.</p>
<p>The sun had not risen above an hour the morning after when the
Portuguese officer came to the spot where we had landed the
preceding evening.&nbsp; He was <!-- page 84--><a
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>tall and
spare, and appeared to be from fifty to fifty-five years old;
and, though thirty years of service under an equatorial sun had
burnt and shrivelled up his face, still there was something in it
so inexpressibly affable and kind, that it set you immediately at
your ease.&nbsp; He came close up to the hammock, and taking hold
of my wrist to feel the pulse, &ldquo;I am sorry, sir,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;to see that the fever has taken such hold of
you.&nbsp; You shall go directly with me,&rdquo; continued he,
&ldquo;to the fort; and though we have no doctor there, I
trust,&rdquo; added he, &ldquo;we shall soon bring you about
again.&nbsp; The orders I have received forbidding the admission
of strangers were never intended to be put in force against a
sick English gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the canoe was proceeding slowly down the river towards the
fort, the commander asked, with much more interest than a
question in ordinary conversation is asked, where was I on the
night of the first of May?&nbsp; On telling him that I was at an
Indian settlement a little below the great fall in the Demerara,
and that a strange and sudden noise had alarmed all the Indians,
he said the same astonishing noise had roused every man in Fort
St. Joachim, and that they remained under arms till
morning.&nbsp; He observed that he had been quite at a loss to
form any idea what could have caused the noise; but now learning
<!-- page 85--><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span>that the same noise had been heard at the same time far
away from the Rio Branco, it struck him there must have been an
earthquake somewhere or other.</p>
<p>Good nourishment and rest, and the unwearied attention and
kindness of the Portuguese commander, stopped the progress of the
fever, and enabled me to walk about in six days.</p>
<p>Fort St. Joachim was built about five-and-forty years ago,
under the apprehension, it is said, that the Spaniards were
coming from the Rio Negro to settle there.&nbsp; It has been much
neglected; the floods of water have carried away the gate, and
destroyed the wall on each side of it; but the present commander
is putting it into thorough repair.&nbsp; When finished, it will
mount six nine- and six twelve-pounders.</p>
<p>In a straight line with the fort, and within a few yards of
the river, stand the commander&rsquo;s house, the barracks, the
chapel, the father confessor&rsquo;s house, and two others, all
at little intervals from each other; and these are the only
buildings at Fort St. Joachim.&nbsp; The neighbouring extensive
plains afford good pasturage for a fine breed of cattle, and the
Portuguese make enough of butter and cheese for their own
consumption.</p>
<p>On asking the old officer if there were such a place as Lake
Parima, or El Dorado, he replied, he looked <!-- page 86--><a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>upon it as
imaginary altogether.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have been above forty
years,&rdquo; added he, &ldquo;in Portuguese Guiana, but have
never yet met with anybody who has seen the lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So much for Lake Parima, or El Dorado, or the White Sea.&nbsp;
Its existence at best seems doubtful; some affirm that there is
such a place, and others deny it.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Grammatici certant, et adhuc sub judice lis
est.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having now reached the Portuguese inland frontier, and
collected a sufficient quantity of the wourali-poison, nothing
remains but to give a brief account of its composition, its
effects, its uses, and its supposed antidotes.</p>
<p>It has been already remarked that in the extensive wilds of
Demerara and Essequibo, far away from any European settlement,
there is a tribe of Indians who are known by the name of
Macoushi.</p>
<p>Though the wourali-poison is used by all the South American
savages betwixt the Amazons and the Oroonoque, still this tribe
makes it stronger than any of the rest.&nbsp; The Indians in the
vicinity of the Rio Negro are aware of this, and come to the
Macoushi country to purchase it.</p>
<p>Much has been said concerning this fatal and extraordinary
poison.&nbsp; Some have affirmed that its effects <!-- page
87--><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>are
almost instantaneous, provided the minutest particle of it mixes
with the blood; and others again have maintained that it is not
strong enough to kill an animal of the size and strength of a
man.&nbsp; The first have erred by lending a too willing ear to
the marvellous, and believing assertions without sufficient
proof.&nbsp; The following short story points out the necessity
of a cautious examination:&mdash;</p>
<p>One day, on asking an Indian if he thought the poison would
kill a man, he replied that they always go to battle with it;
that he was standing by when an Indian was shot with a poisoned
arrow, and that he expired almost immediately.&nbsp; Not wishing
to dispute this apparently satisfactory information, the subject
was dropped.&nbsp; However, about an hour after, having purposely
asked him in what part of the body the said Indian was wounded,
he answered without hesitation that the arrow entered betwixt his
shoulders, and passed quite through his heart.&nbsp; Was it the
weapon, or the strength of the poison, that brought on immediate
dissolution in this case?&nbsp; Of course the weapon.</p>
<p>The second have been misled by disappointment, caused by
neglect in keeping the poisoned arrows, or by not knowing how to
use them, or by trying inferior poison.&nbsp; If the arrows are
not kept dry, the poison loses its strength; and in wet or damp
weather it <!-- page 88--><a name="page88"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 88</span>turns mouldy, and becomes quite
soft.&nbsp; In shooting an arrow in this state, upon examining
the place where it has entered, it will be observed that, though
the arrow has penetrated deep into the flesh, still by far the
greatest part of the poison has shrunk back, and thus, instead of
entering with the arrow, it has remained collected at the mouth
of the wound.&nbsp; In this case the arrow might as well not have
been poisoned.&nbsp; Probably, it was to this that a gentleman,
some time ago, owed his disappointment, when he tried the poison
on a horse in the town of Stabroek, the capital of Demerara; the
horse never betrayed the least symptom of being affected by
it.</p>
<p>Wishful to obtain the best information concerning this poison,
and as repeated inquiries, in lieu of dissipating the surrounding
shade, did but tend more and more to darken the little light that
existed, I determined to penetrate into the country where the
poisonous ingredients grow, where this pernicious composition is
prepared, and where it is constantly used.&nbsp; Success attended
the adventure; and the information acquired made amends for one
hundred and twenty days passed in the solitudes of Guiana, and
afforded a balm to the wounds and bruises which every traveller
must expect to receive who wanders through a thorny and
obstructed path.</p>
<p>Thou must not, courteous reader, expect a <!-- page 89--><a
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>dissertation
on the manner in which the wourali-poison operates on the system;
a treatise has been already written on the subject; and, after
all, there is probably still reason to doubt.&nbsp; It is
supposed to affect the nervous system, and thus destroy the vital
functions; it is also said to be perfectly harmless, provided it
does not touch the blood.&nbsp; However, this is certain, when a
sufficient quantity of it enters the blood, death is the
inevitable consequence; but there is no alteration in the colour
of the blood, and both the blood and flesh may be eaten with
safety.</p>
<p>All that thou wilt find here is a concise, unadorned account
of the wourali-poison.&nbsp; It may be of service to thee some
time or other, shouldst thou ever travel through the wilds where
it is used.&nbsp; Neither attribute to cruelty, nor to a want of
feeling for the sufferings of the inferior animals, the ensuing
experiments.&nbsp; The larger animals were destroyed in order to
have proof positive of the strength of a poison which hath
hitherto been doubted: and the smaller ones were killed with the
hope of substantiating that which has commonly been supposed to
be an antidote.</p>
<p>It makes a pitying heart ache to see a poor creature in
distress and pain; and too often has the compassionate traveller
occasion to heave a sigh as he journeys on.&nbsp; However, here,
though the kind-hearted will be sorry to read of an unoffending
animal doomed <!-- page 90--><a name="page90"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 90</span>to death in order to satisfy a doubt,
still it will be a relief to know that the victim was not
tortured.&nbsp; The wourali-poison destroys life&rsquo;s action
so gently, that the victim appears to be in no pain whatever; and
probably, were the truth known, it feels none, saving the
momentary smart at the time the arrow enters.</p>
<p>A day or two before the Macoushi Indian prepares his poison,
he goes into the forest in quest of the ingredients.&nbsp; A vine
grows in these wilds, which is called wourali.&nbsp; It is from
this that the poison takes its name, and it is the principal
ingredient.&nbsp; When he has procured enough of this, he digs up
a root of a very bitter taste, ties them together, and then looks
about for two kinds of bulbous plants, which contain a green and
glutinous juice.&nbsp; He fills a little quake, which he carries
on his back, with the stalks of these; and, lastly, ranges up and
down till he finds two species of ants.&nbsp; One of them is very
large and black, and so venomous that its sting produces a fever;
it is most commonly to be met with on the ground.&nbsp; The other
is a little red ant, which stings like a nettle, and generally
has its nest under the leaf of a shrub.&nbsp; After obtaining
these, he has no more need to range the forest.</p>
<p>A quantity of the strongest Indian pepper is used; but this he
has already planted round his hut.&nbsp; The <!-- page 91--><a
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>pounded fangs
of the labarri snake, and those of the counacouchi, are likewise
added.&nbsp; These he commonly has in store; for when he kills a
snake, he generally extracts the fangs, and keeps them by
him.</p>
<p>Having thus found the necessary ingredients, he scrapes the
wourali vine and bitter root into thin shavings, and puts them
into a kind of colander made of leaves; this he holds over an
earthen pot, and pours water on the shavings: the liquor which
comes through has the appearance of coffee.&nbsp; When a
sufficient quantity has been procured, the shavings are thrown
aside.&nbsp; He then bruises the bulbous stalks and squeezes a
proportionate quantity of their juice through his hands into the
pot.&nbsp; Lastly, the snakes&rsquo; fangs, ants, and pepper are
bruised, and thrown into it.&nbsp; It is then placed on a slow
fire, and as it boils more of the juice of the wourali is added,
according as it may be found necessary, and the scum is taken off
with a leaf: it remains on the fire till reduced to a thick syrup
of a deep brown colour.&nbsp; As soon as it has arrived at this
state, a few arrows are poisoned with it to try its
strength.&nbsp; If it answers the expectations, it is poured out
into a calabash, or little pot of Indian manufacture, which is
carefully covered with a couple of leaves, and over them a piece
of deer&rsquo;s skin, tied round with a cord.&nbsp; They keep it
in the most dry part of the hut; and from time to time <!-- page
92--><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
92</span>suspend it over the fire, to counteract the effects of
dampness.</p>
<p>The act of preparing this poison is not considered as a common
one: the savage may shape his bow, fasten the barb on the point
of his arrow, and make his other implements of destruction,
either lying in his hammock, or in the midst of his family; but
if he has to prepare the wourali-poison, many precautions are
supposed to be necessary.</p>
<p>The women and young girls are not allowed to be present, lest
the yabahou, or evil spirit, should do them harm.&nbsp; The shed
under which it has been boiled has been pronounced polluted and
abandoned ever after.&nbsp; He who makes the poison must eat
nothing that morning, and must continue fasting as long as the
operation lasts.&nbsp; The pot in which it is boiled must be a
new one, and must never have held anything before, otherwise the
poison would be deficient in strength: add to this that the
operator must take particular care not to expose himself to the
vapour which arises from it while on the fire.</p>
<p>Though this and other precautions are taken, such as
frequently washing the face and hands, still the Indians think
that it affects the health; and the operator either is, or, what
is more probable, supposes himself to be, sick for some days
after.</p>
<p>Thus it appears that the making the wourali-poison <!-- page
93--><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>is
considered as a gloomy and mysterious operation; and it would
seem that they imagine it affects others as well as him who boils
it; for an Indian agreed one evening to make some for me, but the
next morning he declined having anything to do with it, alleging
that his wife was with child!</p>
<p>Here it might be asked, are all the ingredients just mentioned
necessary, in order to produce the wourali-poison?&nbsp; Though
our opinions and conjectures may militate against the absolute
necessity of some of them, still it would be hardly fair to
pronounce them added by the hand of superstition, till proof
positive can he obtained.</p>
<p>We might argue on the subject, and, by bringing forward
instances of Indian superstition, draw our conclusion by
inference, and still remain in doubt on this head.&nbsp; You know
superstition to be the offspring of ignorance, and of course that
it takes up its abode amongst the rudest tribes of uncivilised
man.&nbsp; It even too often resides with man in his more
enlightened state.</p>
<p>The Augustan age furnishes numerous examples.&nbsp; A bone
snatched from the jaws of a fasting bitch, and a feather from the
wing of a night-owl,&mdash;&ldquo;ossa ab ore rapta jejun&aelig;
canis, plumamque nocturn&aelig; strigis,&rdquo;&mdash;were
necessary for Canidia&rsquo;s incantations.&nbsp; And in
aftertimes, Parson Evans, the Welshman, was treated <!-- page
94--><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>most
ungenteelly by an enraged spirit, solely because he had forgotten
a fumigation in his witch-work.&nbsp; If, then, enlightened man
lets his better sense give way, and believes, or allows himself
to be persuaded, that certain substances and actions, in reality
of no avail, possess a virtue which renders them useful in
producing the wished-for effect; may not the wild, untaught,
unenlightened savage of Guiana, add an ingredient which, on
account of the harm it does him, he fancies may be useful in the
perfection of his poison, though, in fact, it be of no use at
all?&nbsp; If a bone snatched from the jaws of a fasting bitch be
thought necessary in incantation; or if witchcraft have recourse
to the raiment of the owl, because it resorts to the tombs and
mausoleums of the dead, and wails and hovers about at the time
that the rest of animated nature sleeps; certainly the savage may
imagine that the ants, whose sting causes a fever, and the teeth
of the labarri and counacouchi snakes, which convey death in a
very short space of time, are essentially necessary in the
composition of his poison; and being once impressed with this
idea, he will add them every time he makes the poison, and
transmit the absolute use of them to his posterity.&nbsp; The
question to be answered seems not to be if it is natural for the
Indians to mix these ingredients, but if they are essential to
make the poison.</p>
<p><!-- page 95--><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
95</span>So much for the preparing of this vegetable
essence&mdash;terrible importer of death into whatever animal it
enters.&nbsp; Let us now see how it is used; let us examine the
weapons which bear it to its destination, and take a view of the
poor victim, from the time he receives his wound till death comes
to his relief.</p>
<p>When a native of Macoushia goes in quest of feathered game or
other birds, he seldom carries his bow and arrows.&nbsp; It is
the blow-pipe he then uses.&nbsp; This extraordinary tube of
death is, perhaps, one of the greatest natural curiosities of
Guiana.&nbsp; It is not found in the country of the
Macoushi.&nbsp; Those Indians tell you that it grows to the
south-west of them, in the wilds which extend betwixt them and
the Rio Negro.&nbsp; The reed must grow to an amazing length, as
the part the Indians use is from ten to eleven feet long, and no
tapering can be perceived in it, one end being as thick as the
other.&nbsp; It is of a bright yellow colour, perfectly smooth
both inside and out.&nbsp; It grows hollow; nor is there the
least appearance of a knot or joint throughout the whole
extent.&nbsp; The natives call it ourah.&nbsp; This, of itself,
is too slender to answer the end of a blow-pipe; but there is a
species of palma, larger and stronger, and common in Guiana, and
this the Indians make use of as a case, in which they put the
ourah.&nbsp; It is brown, susceptible of a fine polish, and
appears as if it had joints five or six <!-- page 96--><a
name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>inches from
each other.&nbsp; It is called samourah, and the pulp inside is
easily extracted, by steeping it for a few days in water.</p>
<p>Thus the ourah and samourah, one within the other, form the
blow-pipe of Guiana.&nbsp; The end which is applied to the mouth
is tied round with a small silk-grass cord, to prevent its
splitting; and the other end, which is apt to strike against the
ground, is secured by the seed of the acuero fruit, cut
horizontally through the middle, with a hole made in the end,
through which is put the extremity of the blow-pipe.&nbsp; It is
fastened on with string on the outside, and the inside is filled
up with wild bees&rsquo;-wax.</p>
<p>The arrow is from nine to ten inches long.&nbsp; It is made
out of the leaf of a species of palm-tree, called coucourito,
hard and brittle, and pointed as sharp as a needle.&nbsp; About
an inch of the pointed end is poisoned.&nbsp; The other end is
burnt to make it still harder, and wild cotton is put round it
for about an inch and a half.&nbsp; It requires considerable
practice to put on this cotton well.&nbsp; It must just be large
enough to fit the hollow of the tube, and taper off to nothing
downwards.&nbsp; They tie it on with a thread of the silk-grass,
to prevent its slipping off the arrow.</p>
<p>The Indians have shown ingenuity in making a quiver to hold
the arrows.&nbsp; It will contain from five to six hundred.&nbsp;
It is generally from twelve to <!-- page 97--><a
name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>fourteen
inches long, and in shape resembles a dice-box used at
backgammon.&nbsp; The inside is prettily done in basket-work,
with wood not unlike bamboo, and the outside has a coat of
wax.&nbsp; The cover is all of one piece, formed out of the skin
of the tapir.&nbsp; Round the centre there is fastened a loop,
large enough to admit the arm and shoulder, from which it hangs
when used.&nbsp; To the rim is tied a little bunch of silk-grass,
and half of the jawbone of the fish called pirai, with which the
Indian scrapes the point of his arrow.</p>
<p>Before he puts the arrows into the quiver, he links them
together by two strings of cotton, one string at each end, and
then folds them round a stick, which is nearly the length of the
quiver.&nbsp; The end of the stick, which is uppermost, is
guarded by two little pieces of wood crosswise, with a hoop round
their extremities, which appears something like a wheel; and this
saves the hand from being wounded when the quiver is reversed in
order to let the bunch of arrows drop out.</p>
<p>There is also attached to the quiver a little kind of basket,
to hold the wild cotton, which is put on the blunt end of the
arrow.&nbsp; With a quiver of poisoned arrows slung over his
shoulder, and with his blowpipe in his hand, in the same position
as a soldier carries his musket, see the Macoushi Indian
advancing towards the forest in quest of powises, maroudis,
waracabas, and other feathered game.</p>
<p><!-- page 98--><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span>These generally sit high up in the tall and tufted
trees, but still are not out of the Indian&rsquo;s reach; for his
blowpipe, at its greatest elevation, will send an arrow three
hundred feet.&nbsp; Silent as midnight he steals under them, and
so cautiously does he tread the ground that the fallen leaves
rustle not beneath his feet.&nbsp; His ears are open to the least
sound, while his eye, keen as that of the lynx, is employed in
finding out the game in the thickest shade.&nbsp; Often he
imitates their cry, and decoys them from tree to tree, till they
are within range of his tube.&nbsp; Then taking a poisoned arrow
from his quiver, he puts it in the blowpipe, and collects his
breath for the fatal puff.</p>
<p>About two feet from the end through which he blows there are
fastened two teeth of the acouri, and these serve him for a
sight.&nbsp; Silent and swift the arrow flies, and seldom fails
to pierce the object at which it is sent.&nbsp; Sometimes the
wounded bird remains in the same tree where it was shot, and in
three minutes falls down at the Indian&rsquo;s feet.&nbsp; Should
he take wing, his flight is of short duration, and the Indian,
following the direction he has gone, is sure to find him
dead.</p>
<p>It is natural to imagine that, when a slight wound only is
inflicted, the game will make its escape.&nbsp; Far otherwise;
the wourali-poison almost instantaneously mixes with blood or
water, so that if you wet your <!-- page 99--><a
name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>finger, and
dash it along the poisoned arrow in the quickest manner possible,
you are sure to carry off some of the poison.&nbsp; Though three
minutes generally elapse before the convulsions come on in the
wounded bird, still a stupor evidently takes place sooner, and
this stupor manifests itself by an apparent unwillingness in the
bird to move.&nbsp; This was very visible in a dying fowl.</p>
<p>Having procured a healthy full-grown one, a short piece of a
poisoned blowpipe arrow was broken off and run up into its thigh,
as near as possible betwixt the skin and the flesh, in order that
it might not be incommoded by the wound.&nbsp; For the first
minute it walked about, but walked very slowly, and did not
appear the least agitated.&nbsp; During the second minute it
stood still, and began to peck the ground; and ere half another
had elapsed, it frequently opened and shut its mouth.&nbsp; The
tail had now dropped, and the wings almost touched the
ground.&nbsp; By the termination of the third minute, it had sat
down, scarce able to support its head, which nodded, and then
recovered itself, and then nodded again, lower and lower every
time, like that of a weary traveller slumbering in an erect
position; the eyes alternately open and shut.&nbsp; The fourth
minute brought on convulsions, and life and the fifth terminated
together.</p>
<p>The flesh of the game is not in the least injured by <!-- page
100--><a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>the poison, nor does it appear to corrupt sooner than
that killed by the gun or knife.&nbsp; The body of this fowl was
kept for sixteen hours, in a climate damp and rainy, and within
seven degrees of the equator; at the end of which time it had
contracted no bad smell whatever, and there were no symptoms of
putrefaction, saving that, just round the wound, the flesh
appeared somewhat discoloured.</p>
<p>The Indian, on his return home, carefully suspends his
blowpipe from the top of his spiral roof; seldom placing it in an
oblique position, lest it should receive a cast.</p>
<p>Here let the blowpipe remain suspended, while you take a view
of the arms which are made to slay the larger beasts of the
forest.</p>
<p>When the Indian intends to chase the peccari, or surprise the
deer, or rouse the tapir from his marshy retreat, he carries his
bow and arrows, which are very different from the weapons already
described.</p>
<p>The bow is generally from six to seven feet long, and strung
with a cord, spun out of the silk-grass.&nbsp; The forests of
Guiana furnish many species of hard wood, tough and elastic, out
of which beautiful and excellent bows are formed.</p>
<p>The arrows are from four to five feet in length, made of a
yellow reed without a knot or joint.&nbsp; It is found in great
plenty up and down throughout Guiana.&nbsp; <!-- page 101--><a
name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>A piece of
hard wood, about nine inches long, is inserted into the end of
the reed, and fastened with cotton well waxed.&nbsp; A square
hole, an inch deep, is then made in the end of this piece of hard
wood, done tight round with cotton to keep it from
splitting.&nbsp; Into this square hole is fitted a spike of
coucourite wood, poisoned, and which may be kept there, or taken
out at pleasure.&nbsp; A joint of bamboo, about as thick as your
finger, is fitted on over the poisoned spike, to prevent
accidents and defend it from the rain, and is taken off when the
arrow is about to be used.&nbsp; Lastly, two feathers are
fastened on the other end of the reed to steady it in its
flight.</p>
<p>Besides his bow and arrows, the Indian carries a little box
made of bamboo, which holds a dozen or fifteen poisoned spikes
six inches long.&nbsp; They are poisoned in the following manner:
a small piece of wood is dipped in the poison, and with this they
give the spike a first coat.&nbsp; It is then exposed to the sun
or fire.&nbsp; After it is dry, it receives another coat, and is
then dried again; after this a third coat, and sometimes a
fourth.</p>
<p>They take great care to put the poison on thicker at the
middle than at the sides, by which means the spike retains the
shape of a two-edged sword.&nbsp; It is rather a tedious
operation to make one of these arrows complete; and as the Indian
is not famed for industry, <!-- page 102--><a
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>except when
pressed by hunger, he has hit upon a plan of preserving his
arrows which deserves notice.</p>
<p>About a quarter of an inch above the part where the coucourite
spike is fixed into the square hole, he cuts it half through; and
thus, when it has entered the animal, the weight of the arrow
causes it to break off there, by which means the arrow falls to
the ground uninjured; so that, should this be the only arrow he
happens to have with him, and should another shot immediately
occur, he has only to take another poisoned spike out of his
little bamboo box, fit it on his arrow, and send it to its
destination.</p>
<p>Thus armed with deadly poison, and hungry as the hy&aelig;na,
he ranges through the forest in quest of the wild beast&rsquo;s
track.&nbsp; No hound can act a surer part.&nbsp; Without clothes
to fetter him, or shoes to bind his feet, he observes the
footsteps of the game, where an European eye could not discern
the smallest vestige.&nbsp; He pursues it through all its turns
and windings with astonishing perseverance, and success generally
crowns his efforts.&nbsp; The animal, after receiving the
poisoned arrow, seldom retreats two hundred paces before it
drops.</p>
<p>In passing overland from the Essequibo to the Demerara we fell
in with a herd of wild hogs.&nbsp; Though encumbered with
baggage, and fatigued with a hard day&rsquo;s walk, an Indian got
his bow ready; and <!-- page 103--><a name="page103"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 103</span>let fly a poisoned arrow at one of
them.&nbsp; It entered the cheek-bone and broke off.&nbsp; The
wild hog was found quite dead about one hundred and seventy paces
from the place where he had been shot.&nbsp; He afforded us an
excellent and wholesome supper.</p>
<p>Thus the savage of Guiana, independent of the common weapons
of destruction, has it in his power to prepare a poison, by which
he can generally ensure to himself a supply of animal food; and
the food so destroyed imbibes no deleterious qualities.&nbsp;
Nature has been bountiful to him.&nbsp; She has not only ordered
poisonous herbs and roots to grow in the unbounded forests
through which he strays, but has also furnished an excellent reed
for his arrows, and another, still more singular, for his
blowpipe; and planted trees of an amazing hard, tough, and
elastic texture, out of which he forms his bows.&nbsp; And in
order that nothing might be wanting, she has superadded a tree
which yields him a fine wax, and disseminated up and down, a
plant not unlike that of the pineapple, which affords him capital
bowstrings.</p>
<p>Having now followed the Indian in the chase, and described the
poison, let us take a nearer view of its action, and observe a
large animal expiring under the weight of its baneful
virulence.</p>
<p>Many have doubted the strength of the wourali poison.&nbsp;
Should they ever by chance read what follows, <!-- page 104--><a
name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>probably
their doubts on that score will be settled for ever.</p>
<p>In the former experiment on the hog some faint resistance on
the part of nature was observed, as if existence struggled for
superiority; but in the following instance of the sloth life sank
in death without the least apparent contention, without a cry,
without a struggle, and without a groan.&nbsp; This was an ai, or
three-toed sloth.&nbsp; It was in the possession of a gentleman
who was collecting curiosities.&nbsp; He wished to have it
killed, in order to preserve the skin, and the wourali-poison was
resorted to as the easiest death.</p>
<p>Of all animals, not even the toad and tortoise excepted, this
poor ill-formed creature is the most tenacious of life.&nbsp; It
exists long after it has received wounds which would have
destroyed any other animal; and it may be said, on seeing a
mortally wounded sloth, that life disputes with death every inch
of flesh in its body.</p>
<p>The ai was wounded in the leg, and put down on the floor,
about two feet from the table; it contrived to reach the leg of
the table, and fastened himself on it, as if wishful to
ascend.&nbsp; But this was its last advancing step: life was
ebbing fast, though imperceptibly; nor could this singular
production of nature, which has been formed of a texture to
resist death in a thousand shapes, make any stand against the
wourali-poison.</p>
<p><!-- page 105--><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span>First, one fore-leg let go its hold, and dropped down
motionless by its side; the other gradually did the same.&nbsp;
The fore-legs having now lost their strength, the sloth slowly
doubled its body, and placed its head betwixt its hind-legs,
which still adhered to the table; but when the poison had
affected these also it sank to the ground, but sank so gently,
that you could not distinguish the movement from an ordinary
motion; and had you been ignorant that it was wounded with a
poisoned arrow, you would never have suspected that it was
dying.&nbsp; Its mouth was shut, nor had any froth or saliva
collected there.</p>
<p>There was no <i>subsultus tendinum</i>, or any visible
alteration in its breathing.&nbsp; During the tenth minute from
the time it was wounded it stirred, and that was all; and the
minute after life&rsquo;s last spark went out.&nbsp; From the
time the poison began to operate, you would have conjectured that
sleep was overpowering it, and you would have exclaimed,
&ldquo;Pressitque jacentem, dulcis et alta quies,
placid&aelig;que simillima morti.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are now two positive proofs of the effect of this fatal
poison, viz., the death of the hog, and that of the sloth.&nbsp;
But still these animals were nothing remarkable for size; and the
strength of the poison in large animals might yet be doubted,
were it not for what follows.</p>
<p>A large well-fed ox, from nine hundred to a thousand
pounds&rsquo; weight, was tied to a stake by a rope <!-- page
106--><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
106</span>sufficiently long to allow him to move to and
fro.&nbsp; Having no large coucourito spikes at hand, it was
judged necessary, on account of his superior size, to put three
wild-hog arrows into him; one was sent into each thigh just above
the hock, in order to avoid wounding a vital part, and the third
was shot transversely into the extremity of the nostril.</p>
<p>The poison seemed to take effect in four minutes.&nbsp;
Conscious as though he would fall, the ox set himself firmly on
his legs, and remained quite still in the same place till about
the fourteenth minute, when he smelled the ground, and appeared
as if inclined to walk.&nbsp; He advanced a pace or two,
staggered, and fell, and remained extended on his side with his
head on the ground.&nbsp; His eye, a few minutes ago so bright
and lively, now became fixed and dim, and though you put your
hand close to it, as if to give him a blow there, he never closed
his eyelid.</p>
<p>His legs were convulsed, and his head from time to time
started involuntarily; but he never showed the least desire to
raise it from the ground; he breathed hard, and emitted foam from
his mouth.&nbsp; The startings, or <i>subsultus tendinum</i>, now
became gradually weaker and weaker; his hinder parts were fixed
in death; and in a minute or two more his head and fore-legs
ceased to stir.</p>
<p>Nothing now remained to show that life was still <!-- page
107--><a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
107</span>within him, except that his heart faintly beat and
fluttered at intervals.&nbsp; In five-and-twenty minutes from the
time of his being wounded he was quite dead.&nbsp; His flesh was
very sweet and savoury at dinner.</p>
<p>On taking a retrospective view of the two different kinds of
poisoned arrows, and the animals destroyed by them, it would
appear that the quantity of poison must be proportioned to the
animal, and thus those probably labour under an error who imagine
that the smallest particle of it introduced into the blood has
almost instantaneous effects.</p>
<p>Make an estimate of the difference in size betwixt the fowl
and the ox, and then weigh a sufficient quantity of poison for a
blowpipe arrow with which the fowl was killed, and weigh also
enough poison for three wild-hog arrows which destroyed the ox,
and it will appear that the fowl received much more poison in
proportion than the ox.&nbsp; Hence the cause why the fowl died
in five minutes and the ox in five-and-twenty.</p>
<p>Indeed, were it the case that the smallest particle of it
introduced into the blood has almost instantaneous effects, the
Indian would not find it necessary to make the large arrow; that
of the blowpipe is much easier made and requires less poison.</p>
<p>And now for the antidotes, or rather the supposed
antidotes.&nbsp; The Indians tell you, that if the wounded <!--
page 108--><a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
108</span>animal be held for a considerable time up to the mouth
in water, the poison will not prove fatal; also that the juice of
the sugar-cane poured down the throat will counteract the effects
of it.&nbsp; These antidotes were fairly tried upon full-grown
healthy fowls, but they all died, as though no steps had been
taken to preserve their lives.&nbsp; Rum was recommended and
given to another, but with as little success.</p>
<p>It is supposed by some that wind introduced into the lungs by
means of a small pair of bellows would revive the poisoned
patient, provided the operation be continued for a sufficient
length of time.&nbsp; It may be so; but this is a difficult and a
tedious mode of cure, and he who is wounded in the forest far
away from his friends, or in the hut of the savages, stands but a
poor chance of being saved by it.</p>
<p>Had the Indians a sure antidote, it is likely they would carry
it about with them, or resort to it immediately after being
wounded, if at hand; and their confidence in its efficacy would
greatly diminish the horror they betray when you point a poisoned
arrow at them.</p>
<p>One day, while we were eating a red monkey, erroneously called
the baboon of Demerara, an Arowack Indian told an affecting story
of what happened to a comrade of his.&nbsp; He was present at his
death.&nbsp; As it did not interest this Indian in any point to
tell a <!-- page 109--><a name="page109"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 109</span>falsehood it is very probable that
his account was a true one.&nbsp; If so, it appears that there is
no certain antidote, or at least an antidote that could be
resorted to in a case of urgent need; for the Indian gave up all
thoughts of life as soon as he was wounded.</p>
<p>The Arowack Indian said it was but four years ago that he and
his companion were ranging in the forest in quest of game.&nbsp;
His companion took a poisoned arrow, and sent it at a red monkey
in a tree above him.&nbsp; It was nearly a perpendicular
shot.&nbsp; The arrow missed the monkey, and in the descent
struck him in the arm a little above the elbow.&nbsp; He was
convinced it was all over with him.&nbsp; &ldquo;I shall
never,&rdquo; said he to his companion in a faltering voice, and
looking at his bow as he said it, &ldquo;I shall never,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;bend this bow again.&rdquo;&nbsp; And having said
that he took off his little bamboo poison-box, which hung across
his shoulder, and putting it, together with his bow and arrows,
on the ground, he laid himself down close by them, bid his
companion farewell, and never spoke more.</p>
<p>He who is unfortunate enough to be wounded by a poisoned arrow
from Macoushia had better not depend upon the common antidotes
for a cure.&nbsp; Many who have been in Guiana will recommend
immediate immersion in water, or to take the juice of the
sugar-cane, or to fill the mouth full of salt; and, they <!--
page 110--><a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>recommend these antidotes because they have got them
from the Indians.&nbsp; But were you to ask them if they ever saw
these antidotes used with success, it is ten to one their answer
would be in the negative.</p>
<p>Wherefore let him reject these antidotes as unprofitable, and
of no avail.&nbsp; He has got an active and a deadly foe within
him, which, like Shakespeare&rsquo;s fell Sergeant Death, is
strict in his arrest, and will allow him but little
time&mdash;very, very little time.&nbsp; In a few minutes he will
be numbered with the dead.&nbsp; Life ought, if possible, to be
preserved, be the expense ever so great.&nbsp; Should the part
affected admit of it, let a ligature be tied tight round the
wound, and have immediate recourse to the knife:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Continuo, culpam ferro compesce
priusquam,<br />
Dira per infaustum serpant contagia corpus.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And now, kind reader, it is time to bid thee farewell.&nbsp;
The two ends proposed have been obtained.&nbsp; The Portuguese
inland frontier fort has been reached, and the Macoushi
wourali-poison acquired.&nbsp; The account of this excursion
through the interior of Guiana has been submitted to thy perusal,
in order to induce thy abler genius to undertake a more extensive
one.&nbsp; If any difficulties have arisen, or fevers come on,
they have been caused by the periodical rains, which fall in
torrents as the sun approaches the tropic of Cancer.&nbsp; In dry
weather there would be no difficulties or sickness.</p>
<p><!-- page 111--><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>Amongst the many satisfactory conclusions which thou
wouldst be able to draw during the journey, there is one which,
perhaps, would please thee not a little, and that is with regard
to dogs.&nbsp; Many a time, no doubt, thou hast heard it hotly
disputed that dogs existed in Guiana previously to the arrival of
the Spaniards in those parts.&nbsp; Whatever the Spaniards
introduced, and which bore no resemblance to anything the Indians
had been accustomed to see, retains its Spanish name to this
day.</p>
<p>Thus the Warrow, the Arowack, the Acoway, the Macoushi, and
Carib tribes, call a hat, &ldquo;sombrero;&rdquo; shirt, or any
kind of cloth, &ldquo;camisa;&rdquo; a shoe,
&ldquo;zapato;&rdquo; a letter, &ldquo;carta;&rdquo; a fowl,
&ldquo;gallina;&rdquo; gunpowder, &ldquo;colvora&rdquo; (Spanish,
&ldquo;polvora&rdquo;); ammunition, &ldquo;bala;&rdquo; a cow,
&ldquo;vaca;&rdquo; and a dog, &ldquo;perro.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This argues strongly against the existence of dogs in Guiana
before it was discovered by the Spaniards, and probably may be of
use to thee in thy next canine dispute.</p>
<p>In a political point of view this country presents a large
field for speculation.&nbsp; A few years ago there was but little
inducement for any Englishman to explore the interior of these
rich and fine colonies, as the British Government did not
consider them worth holding at the peace of Amiens.&nbsp; Since
that period their mother-country has been blotted out from the
<!-- page 112--><a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
112</span>list of nations, and America has unfolded a new sheet
of politics.&nbsp; On one side the crown of Braganza, attacked by
an ambitious chieftain, has fled from the palace of its
ancestors, and now seems fixed on the banks of the Janeiro.&nbsp;
Cayenne has yielded to its arms.&nbsp; La Plata has raised the
standard of independence, and thinks itself sufficiently strong
to obtain a government of its own.&nbsp; On the other side, the
Caraccas are in open revolt, and should Santa F&eacute; join them
in good earnest they may form a powerful association.</p>
<p>Thus, on each side of the <i>ci-devant</i> Dutch Guiana, most
unexpected and astonishing changes have taken place.&nbsp; Will
they raise or lower it in the scale of estimation at the Court of
St. James&rsquo;s?&nbsp; Will they be of benefit to these grand
and extensive colonies?&mdash;colonies enjoying perpetual
summer&mdash;colonies of the richest soil&mdash;colonies
containing within themselves everything necessary for their
support&mdash;colonies, in fine, so varied in their quality and
situation, as to be capable of bringing to perfection every
tropical production; and only want the support of government, and
an enlightened governor, to render them as fine as the finest
portions of the equatorial regions.&nbsp; Kind reader, fare thee
well.</p>

<h3><!-- page 114--><a name="page114"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 114</span>REMARKS.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Incertus, quo fata ferant, ubi sistera
detur.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kind and gentle reader, if the journey in quest of the
wourali-poison has engaged thy attention, probably thou mayst
recollect that the traveller took leave of thee at Fort St.
Joachim, on the Rio Branco.&nbsp; Shouldst thou wish to know what
befell him afterwards, excuse the following uninteresting
narrative.</p>
<p>Having had a return of fever, and aware that the farther he
advanced into these wild and lonely regions the less would be the
chance of regaining his health, he gave up all idea of proceeding
onwards, and went slowly back towards the Demerara nearly by the
same route he had come.</p>
<p>On descending the falls in the Essequibo, which form an
oblique line quite across the river, it was resolved to push
through them, the downward stream being in the canoe&rsquo;s
favour.&nbsp; At a little distance from the place a large tree
had fallen into the river, and in the meantime the canoe was
lashed to one of its branches.</p>
<p>The roaring of the water was dreadful; it foamed and dashed
over the rocks with a tremendous spray, <!-- page 115--><a
name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>like
breakers on a lee-shore, threatening destruction to whatever
approached it.&nbsp; You would have thought, by the confusion it
caused in the river, and the whirlpools it made, that Scylla and
Charybdis, and their whole progeny, had left the Mediterranean,
and come and settled here.&nbsp; The channel was barely twelve
feet wide, and the torrent in rushing down formed transverse
furrows, which showed how near the rocks were to the surface.</p>
<p>Nothing could surpass the skill of the Indian who steered the
canoe.&nbsp; He looked steadfastly at it, then at the rocks, then
cast an eye on the channel, and then looked at the canoe
again.&nbsp; It was in vain to speak.&nbsp; The sound was lost in
the roar of waters; but his eye showed that he had already passed
it in imagination.&nbsp; He held up his paddle in a position, as
much as to say, that he would keep exactly amid channel; and then
made a sign to cut the bush rope that held the canoe to the
fallen tree.&nbsp; The canoe drove down the torrent with
inconceivable rapidity.&nbsp; It did not touch the rocks once all
the way.&nbsp; The Indian proved to a nicety &ldquo;medio
tutissimus ibis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shortly after this it rained almost day and night, the
lightning flashing incessantly, and the roar of thunder awful
beyond expression.</p>
<p>The fever returned, and pressed so heavy on him, that to all
appearance his last day&rsquo;s march was over.&nbsp; <!-- page
116--><a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
116</span>However, it abated; his spirits rallied, and he marched
again; and after delays and inconveniences he reached the house
of his worthy friend Mr. Edmonstone, in Mibiri Creek, which falls
into the Demerara.&nbsp; No words of his can do justice to the
hospitality of that gentleman, whose repeated encounters with the
hostile negroes in the forest have been publicly rewarded, and
will be remembered in the colony for years to come.</p>
<p>Here he learned that an eruption had taken place in St.
Vincent&rsquo;s; and thus the noise heard in the night of the
first of May, which had caused such terror amongst the Indians,
and made the garrison at Fort St. Joachim remain under arms the
rest of the night, is accounted for.</p>
<p>After experiencing every kindness and attention from Mr.
Edmonstone, he sailed for Granada, and from thence to St.
Thomas&rsquo;s, a few days before poor Captain Peake lost his
life on his own quarter-deck, bravely fighting for his country on
the coast of Guiana.</p>
<p>At St. Thomas&rsquo;s they show you a tower, a little distance
from the town, which, they say, formerly belonged to a buccaneer
chieftain.&nbsp; Probably the fury of besiegers has reduced it to
its present dismantled state.&nbsp; What still remains of it
bears testimony of its former strength, and may brave the attack
of time for <!-- page 117--><a name="page117"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 117</span>centuries.&nbsp; You cannot view its
ruins without calling to mind the exploits of those fierce and
hardy hunters, long the terror of the western world.&nbsp; While
you admire their undaunted courage, you lament that it was often
stained with cruelty; while you extol their scrupulous justice to
each other, you will find a want of it towards the rest of
mankind.&nbsp; Often possessed of enormous wealth, often in
extreme poverty, often triumphant on the ocean, and often forced
to fly to the forests, their life was an ever-changing scene of
advance and retreat, of glory and disorder, of luxury and
famine.&nbsp; Spain treated them as outlaws and pirates, while
other European Powers publicly disowned them.&nbsp; They, on the
other hand, maintained that injustice on the part of Spain first
forced them to take up arms in self-defence; and that, whilst
they kept inviolable the laws which they had framed for their own
common benefit and protection, they had a right to consider as
foes those who treated them as outlaws.&nbsp; Under this
impression they drew the sword, and rushed on as though in lawful
war, and divided the spoils of victory in the scale of
justice.</p>
<p>After leaving St. Thomas&rsquo;s a severe tertian ague every
now and then kept putting the traveller in mind that his
shattered frame, &ldquo;starting and shivering in the inconstant
blast, meagre and pale&mdash;the ghost of what it
was&rdquo;&mdash;wanted repairs.&nbsp; Three years elapsed <!--
page 118--><a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
118</span>after arriving in England before the ague took its
final leave of him.</p>
<p>During that time several experiments were made with the
wourali-poison.&nbsp; In London an ass was inoculated with it,
and died in twelve minutes.&nbsp; The poison was inserted into
the leg of another, round which a bandage had been previously
tied a little above the place where the wourali was
introduced.&nbsp; He walked about as usual, and ate his food as
though all were right.&nbsp; After an hour had elapsed the
bandage was untied, and ten minutes after death overtook him.</p>
<p>A she-ass received the wourali-poison in the shoulder, and
died apparently in ten minutes.&nbsp; An incision was then made
in its windpipe, and through it the lungs were regularly inflated
for two hours with a pair of bellows.&nbsp; Suspended animation
returned.&nbsp; The ass held up her head, and looked around; but
the inflating being discontinued, she sank once more in apparent
death.&nbsp; The artificial breathing was immediately
recommenced, and continued without intermission for two hours;
this saved the ass from final dissolution.&nbsp; She rose up, and
walked about; she seemed neither in agitation nor in pain.&nbsp;
The wound, through which the poison entered, was healed without
difficulty.&nbsp; Her constitution, however, was so severely
affected that it was long a doubt if ever she would be well
again.&nbsp; She looked lean and sickly for above a year, <!--
page 119--><a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
119</span>but began to mend the spring after, and by Midsummer
became fat and frisky.</p>
<p>The kind-hearted reader will rejoice on learning that Earl
Percy, pitying her misfortunes, sent her down from London to
Walton Hall, near Wakefield.&nbsp; There she goes by the name of
Wouralia.&nbsp; Wouralia shall be sheltered from the wintry
storm; and when summer comes she shall feed in the finest
pasture.&nbsp; No burden shall be placed upon her, and she shall
end her days in peace.</p>
<p>For three revolving autumns the ague-beaten wanderer never
saw, without a sigh, the swallow bend her flight towards warmer
regions.&nbsp; He wished to go too, but could not; for sickness
had enfeebled him, and prudence pointed out the folly of roving
again too soon across the northern tropic.&nbsp; To be sure, the
Continent was now open, and change of air might prove beneficial;
but there was nothing very tempting in a trip across the Channel,
and as for a tour through England&mdash;England has long ceased
to be the land for adventures.&nbsp; Indeed, when good King
Arthur reappears to claim his crown he will find things strangely
altered here; and may we not look for his coming? for there is
written upon his gravestone:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Hic jacet Arturus, Rex quondam Rexque
futurus,&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Here Arthur lies, who
formerly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was king&mdash;and king again to
be.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 120--><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
120</span>Don Quixote was always of opinion that this famous king
did not die, but that he was changed into a raven by enchantment,
and that the English are momentarily expecting his return.&nbsp;
Be this as it may, it is certain that when he reigned here all
was harmony and joy.&nbsp; The browsing herds passed from vale to
vale, the swains sang from the bluebell-teeming groves, and
nymphs, with eglantine and roses in their neatly-braided hair,
went hand in hand to the flowery mead to weave garlands for their
lambkins.&nbsp; If by chance some rude uncivil fellow dared to
molest them, or attempted to throw thorns in their path, there
was sure to be a knight-errant not far off ready to rush forward
in their defence.&nbsp; But alas! in these degenerate days it is
not so.&nbsp; Should a harmless cottage-maid wander out of the
highway to pluck a primrose or two in the neighbouring field the
haughty owner sternly bids her retire; and if a pitying swain
hasten to escort her back, he is perhaps seized by the gaunt
house-dog ere he reach her.</p>
<p>&AElig;neas&rsquo;s route on the other side of Styx could not
have been much worse than this, though by his account, when he
got back to earth, it appears that he had fallen in with
&ldquo;Bellua Lern&aelig;, horrendum stridens, flammisque, armata
Chim&aelig;ra.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moreover, he had a sibyl to guide his steps; and as such a
conductress nowadays could not be got for <!-- page 121--><a
name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>love nor
money, it was judged most prudent to refrain from sauntering
through this land of freedom, and wait with patience the return
of health.&nbsp; At last this long-looked-for, ever-welcome
stranger came.</p>
<h2><!-- page 122--><a name="page122"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 122</span>SECOND JOURNEY.</h2>
<p>In the year 1816, two days before the vernal equinox, I sailed
from Liverpool for Pernambuco, in the southern hemisphere, on the
coast of Brazil.&nbsp; There is little at this time of the year
in the European part of the Atlantic to engage the attention of
the naturalist.&nbsp; As you go down the Channel you see a few
divers and gannets.&nbsp; The middle-sized gulls, with a black
spot at the end of the wings, attend you a little way into the
Bay of Biscay.&nbsp; When it blows a hard gale of wind the stormy
petrel makes its appearance.&nbsp; While the sea runs mountains
high, and every wave threatens destruction to the labouring
vessel, this little harbinger of storms is seen enjoying itself,
on rapid pinion, up and down the roaring billows.&nbsp; When the
storm is over it appears no more.&nbsp; It is known to every
English sailor by the name of Mother Carey&rsquo;s chicken.&nbsp;
It must have been hatched in &AElig;olus&rsquo;s cave, amongst a
clutch of squalls and tempests; for whenever they get out upon
the ocean it always contrives to be of the party.</p>
<p>Though the calms and storms and adverse winds <!-- page
123--><a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>in
these latitudes are vexatious, still, when you reach the trade
winds, you are amply repaid for all disappointments and
inconveniences.&nbsp; The trade winds prevail about thirty
degrees on each side of the equator.&nbsp; This part of the ocean
may be called the Elysian Fields of Neptune&rsquo;s empire; and
the torrid zone, notwithstanding Ovid&rsquo;s remark, &ldquo;non
est habitabilis &aelig;stu,&rdquo; is rendered healthy and
pleasant by these gently-blowing breezes.&nbsp; The ship glides
smoothly on, and you soon find yourself within the northern
tropic.&nbsp; When you are on it, Cancer is just over your head,
and betwixt him and Capricorn is the high road of the Zodiac,
forty-seven degrees wide, famous for Phaeton&rsquo;s
misadventure.&nbsp; His father begged and entreated him not to
take it into his head to drive parallel to the five zones, but to
mind and keep on the turnpike which runs obliquely across the
equator.&nbsp; &ldquo;There you will distinctly see,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;the ruts of my chariot wheels, &lsquo;manifesta
rot&aelig; vestigia cernes.&rsquo;&nbsp; But,&rdquo; added he,
&ldquo;even suppose you keep on it, and avoid the byroads,
nevertheless, my dear boy, believe me, you will be most sadly put
to your shifts; &lsquo;ardua prima via est,&rsquo; the first part
of the road is confoundedly steep! &lsquo;ultima via prona
est,&rsquo; and after that it is all down hill.&nbsp; Moreover,
&lsquo;per insidias iter est, formasque ferarum,&rsquo; the road
is full of nooses and bull-dogs, &lsquo;H&aelig;moniosque
arcus,&rsquo; <!-- page 124--><a name="page124"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 124</span>and spring guns,
&lsquo;s&aelig;vaque circuitu, curvantem brachia longo,
Scorpio,&rsquo; and steel traps of uncommon size and
shape.&rdquo;&nbsp; These were nothing in the eyes of Phaeton; go
he would, so off he set, full speed, four-in-hand.&nbsp; He had a
tough drive of it; and after doing a prodigious deal of mischief,
very luckily for the world, he got thrown out of the box, and
tumbled into the river Po.</p>
<p>Some of our modern bloods have been shallow enough to try to
ape this poor empty-headed coachman, on a little scale, making
London their Zodiac.&nbsp; Well for them if tradesmen&rsquo;s
bills, and other trivial perplexities, have not caused them to be
thrown into the King&rsquo;s Bench.</p>
<p>The productions of the torrid zone are uncommonly grand.&nbsp;
Its plains, its swamps, its savannas, and forests abound with the
largest serpents and wild beasts; and its trees are the
habitation of the most beautiful of the feathered race.&nbsp;
While the traveller in the Old World is astonished at the
elephant, the tiger, the lion, and the rhinoceros, he who wanders
through the torrid regions of the New is lost in admiration at
the cotingas, the toucans, the humming-birds, and aras.</p>
<p>The ocean, likewise, swarms with curiosities.&nbsp; Probably
the flying-fish may be considered as one of the most
singular.&nbsp; This little scaled inhabitant of water <!-- page
125--><a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
125</span>and air seems to have been more favoured than the rest
of its finny brethren.&nbsp; It can rise out of the waves, and on
wing visit the domain of the birds.</p>
<p>After flying two or three hundred yards, the intense heat of
the sun has dried its pellucid wings, and it is obliged to wet
them in order to continue its flight.&nbsp; It just drops into
the ocean for a moment, and then rises again and flies on; and
then descends to remoisten them, and then up again into the air;
thus passing its life, sometimes wet, sometimes dry, sometimes in
sunshine, and sometimes in the pale moon&rsquo;s nightly beam, as
pleasure dictates, or as need requires.&nbsp; The additional
assistance of wings is not thrown away upon it.&nbsp; It has full
occupation both for fins and wings, as its life is in perpetual
danger.</p>
<p>The bonito and albicore chase it day and night; but the
dolphin is its worst and swiftest foe.&nbsp; If it escape into
the air, the dolphin pushes on with proportional velocity
beneath, and is ready to snap it up the moment it descends to wet
its wings.</p>
<p>You will often see above one hundred of these little marine
a&euml;rial fugitives on the wing at once.&nbsp; They appear to
use every exertion to prolong their flight, but vain are all
their efforts; for when the last drop of water on their wings is
dried up, their flight is at an end, and they must drop into the
ocean.&nbsp; Some are instantly devoured by their merciless
pursuer, <!-- page 126--><a name="page126"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 126</span>part escape by swimming, and others
get out again as quick as possible, and trust once more to their
wings.</p>
<p>It often happens that this unfortunate little creature, after
alternate dips and flights, finding all its exertions of no
avail, at last drops on board the vessel, verifying the old
remark&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Incidit in Scyllam, cupiens vitare
Charybdim.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There, stunned by the fall, it beats the deck with its tail,
and dies.&nbsp; When eating it, you would take it for a fresh
herring.&nbsp; The largest measure from fourteen to fifteen
inches in length.&nbsp; The dolphin, after pursuing it to the
ship, sometimes forfeits his own life.</p>
<p>In days of yore, the musician used to play in softest,
sweetest strain, and then take an airing amongst the dolphins;
&ldquo;inter delphinas Arion.&rdquo;&nbsp; But nowadays, our tars
have quite capsized the custom; and instead of riding ashore on
the dolphin, they invited the dolphin aboard.&nbsp; While he is
darting and playing around the vessel, a sailor goes out to the
spritsailyard-arm, and with a long staff, leaded at one end, and
armed at the other with five barbed spikes, he heaves it at
him.&nbsp; If successful in his aim, there is a fresh mess for
all hands.&nbsp; The dying dolphin affords a superb and brilliant
sight:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Mille trahit moriens, adverso sole
colores.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 127--><a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
127</span>All the colours of the rainbow pass and repass in rapid
succession over his body, till the dark hand of death closes the
scene.</p>
<p>From the Cape de Verd Islands to the coast of Brazil you see
several different kinds of gulls, which probably are bred in the
island of St. Paul.&nbsp; Sometimes the large bird called the
frigate pelican soars majestically over the vessel, and the
tropic-bird comes near enough to let you have a fair view of the
long feathers in his tail.&nbsp; On the line when it is calm
sharks of a tremendous size make their appearance.&nbsp; They are
descried from the ship by means of the dorsal fin, which is above
the water.</p>
<p>On entering the Bay of Pernambuco, the frigate pelican is seen
watching the shoals of fish from a prodigious height.&nbsp; It
seldom descends without a successful attack on its numerous prey
below.</p>
<p>As you approach the shore the view is charming.&nbsp; The
hills are clothed with wood, gradually rising towards the
interior, none of them of any considerable height.&nbsp; A
singular reef of rocks runs parallel to the coast, and forms the
harbour of Pernambuco.&nbsp; The vessels are moored betwixt it
and the town, safe from every storm.&nbsp; You enter the harbour
through a very narrow passage, close by a fort built on the
reef.&nbsp; The hill of Olinda, studded with houses and convents,
is on your right hand, and an island, thickly planted <!-- page
128--><a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
128</span>with cocoa-nut trees, adds considerably to the scene on
your left.&nbsp; There are two strong forts on the isthmus,
betwixt Olinda and Pernambuco, and a pillar midway to aid the
pilot.</p>
<p>Pernambuco probably contains upwards of fifty thousand
souls.&nbsp; It stands on a flat, and is divided into three
parts&mdash;a peninsula, an island, and the continent.&nbsp;
Though within a few degrees of the line, its climate is
remarkably salubrious, and rendered almost temperate by the
refreshing sea-breeze.&nbsp; Had art and judgment contributed
their portion to its natural advantages, Pernambuco at this day
would have been a stately ornament to the coast of Brazil.&nbsp;
On viewing it, it will strike you that every one has built his
house entirely for himself, and deprived public convenience of
the little claim she had a right to put in.&nbsp; You would wish
that this city, so famous for its harbour, so happy in its
climate, and so well situated for commerce, could have risen
under the flag of Dido, in lieu of that of Braganza.</p>
<p>As you walk down the streets, the appearance of the homes is
not much in their favour.&nbsp; Some of them are very high, and
some very low; some newly whitewashed, and others stained and
mouldy and neglected, as though they had no owner.</p>
<p>The balconies, too, are of a dark and gloomy appearance.&nbsp;
They are not, in general, open, as in <!-- page 129--><a
name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>most
tropical cities, but grated like a farmer&rsquo;s dairy window,
though somewhat closer.</p>
<p>There is a lamentable want of cleanliness in the
streets.&nbsp; The impurities from the houses, and the
accumulation of litter from the beasts of burden, are unpleasant
sights to the passing stranger.&nbsp; He laments the want of a
police as he goes along; and when the wind begins to blow, his
nose and eyes are too often exposed to a cloud of very unsavoury
dust.</p>
<p>When you view the port of Pernambuco, full of ships of all
nations; when you know that the richest commodities of Europe,
Africa, and Asia are brought to it; when you see immense
quantities of cotton, dye-wood, and the choicest fruits pouring
into the town, you are apt to wonder at the little attention
these people pay to the common comforts which one always expects
to find in a large and opulent city.&nbsp; However, if the
inhabitants are satisfied, there is nothing more to be
said.&nbsp; Should they ever be convinced that inconveniences
exist, and that nuisances are too frequent, the remedy is in
their own hands.&nbsp; At present, certainly, they seem perfectly
regardless of them; and the Captain-General of Pernambuco walks
through the streets with as apparent content and composure as an
English statesman would proceed down Charing Cross.&nbsp; Custom
reconciles everything.&nbsp; In a week or two the stranger
himself begins <!-- page 130--><a name="page130"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 130</span>to feel less the things which
annoyed him so much upon his first arrival, and after a few
months&rsquo; residence he thinks no more about them, while he is
partaking of the hospitality and enjoying the elegance and
splendour within doors in this great city.</p>
<p>Close by the riverside stands what is called the Palace of the
Captain-General of Pernambuco.&nbsp; Its form and appearance
altogether strike the traveller that it was never intended for
the use it is at present put to.</p>
<p>Reader, throw a veil over thy recollection for a little while,
and forget the cruel, unjust, and unmerited censures thou hast
heard against an unoffending order.&nbsp; This palace was once
the Jesuits&rsquo; college, and originally built by those
charitable fathers.&nbsp; Ask the aged and respectable
inhabitants of Pernambuco, and they will tell thee that the
destruction of the Society of Jesus was a terrible disaster to
the public, and its consequences severely felt to the present
day.</p>
<p>When Pombal took the reins of power into his own hands, virtue
and learning beamed bright within the college walls.&nbsp; Public
catechism to the children, and religious instruction to all,
flowed daily from the mouths of its venerable priests.</p>
<p>They were loved, revered, and respected throughout <!-- page
131--><a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
131</span>the whole town.&nbsp; The illuminating philosophers of
the day had sworn to exterminate Christian knowledge, and the
college of Pernambuco was doomed to founder in the general
storm.&nbsp; To the long-lasting sorrow and disgrace of Portugal,
the philosophers blinded her king and flattered her Prime
Minister.&nbsp; Pombal was exactly the tool these sappers of
every public and private virtue wanted.&nbsp; He had the naked
sword of power in his own hand, and his heart was as hard as
flint.&nbsp; Ho struck a mortal blow, and the Society of Jesus
throughout the Portuguese dominions, was no more.</p>
<p>One morning all the fathers of the college in Pernambuco, some
of them very old and feeble, were suddenly ordered into the
refectory.&nbsp; They had notice beforehand of the fatal storm,
in pity from the governor, but not one of them abandoned his
charge.&nbsp; They had done their duty, and had nothing to
fear.&nbsp; They bowed with resignation to the will of
Heaven.&nbsp; As soon as they had all reached the refectory, they
were there locked up, and never more did they see their rooms,
their friends, their scholars, or acquaintance.&nbsp; In the dead
of the following night, a strong guard of soldiers literally
drove them through the streets to the water&rsquo;s edge.&nbsp;
They were then conveyed in boats aboard a ship, and steered for
Bahia.&nbsp; Those who survived the barbarous treatment <!-- page
132--><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
132</span>they experienced from Pombal&rsquo;s creatures were at
last ordered to Lisbon.&nbsp; The college of Pernambuco was
plundered, and some time after an elephant was kept there.</p>
<p>Thus the arbitrary hand of power, in one night, smote and
swept away the sciences; to which succeeded the low vulgar
buffoonery of a showman.&nbsp; Virgil and Cicero made way for a
wild beast from Angola! and now a guard is on duty at the very
gate where, in times long past, the poor were daily fed!!!</p>
<p>Trust not, kind reader, to the envious remarks which their
enemies have scattered far and near; believe not the stories of
those who have had a hand in the sad tragedy.&nbsp; Go to Brazil,
and see with thine own eyes the effect of Pombal&rsquo;s
short-sighted policy.&nbsp; There vice reigns triumphant, and
learning is at its lowest ebb.&nbsp; Neither is this to be
wondered at.&nbsp; Destroy the compass, and will the vessel find
her far-distant port?&nbsp; Will the flock keep together, and
escape the wolves, after the shepherds are all slain?&nbsp; The
Brazilians were told that public education would go on just as
usual.&nbsp; They might have asked Government, who so able to
instruct our youth as those whose knowledge is proverbial? who so
fit as those who enjoy our entire confidence? who so worthy, as
those whose lives are irreproachable?</p>
<p><!-- page 133--><a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
133</span>They soon found that those who succeeded the fathers of
the Society of Jesus had neither their manner nor their
abilities.&nbsp; They had not made the instruction of youth their
particular study.&nbsp; Moreover, they entered on the field after
a defeat, where the officers had all been slain; where the plan
of the campaign was lost; where all was in sorrow and
dismay.&nbsp; No exertions of theirs could rally the dispersed,
or skill prevent the fatal consequences.&nbsp; At the present day
the seminary of Olinda, in comparison with the former
Jesuits&rsquo; college, is only as the waning moon&rsquo;s beam
to the sun&rsquo;s meridian splendour.</p>
<p>When you visit the places where those learned fathers once
flourished, and see with your own eyes the evils their
dissolution has caused; when you hear the inhabitants telling you
how good, how clever, how charitable they were&mdash;what will
you think of our poet laureate for calling them, in his
&ldquo;History of Brazil,&rdquo; &ldquo;Missioners, whose zeal
the most fanatical was directed by the coolest policy&rdquo;?</p>
<p>Was it <i>fanatical</i> to renounce the honours and comforts
of this transitory life, in order to gain eternal glory in the
next, by denying themselves, and taking up the cross?&nbsp; Was
it <i>fanatical</i> to preach salvation to innumerable wild
hordes of Americans, to clothe the naked, to encourage the
repenting sinner, to <!-- page 134--><a name="page134"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 134</span>aid the dying Christian?&nbsp; The
fathers of the Society of Jesus did all this.&nbsp; And for this
their zeal is pronounced to be the most fanatical, directed by
the coolest policy.&nbsp; It will puzzle many a clear brain to
comprehend how it is possible, in the nature of things, that
<i>zeal</i> the most <i>fanatical</i> should be directed by the
<i>coolest policy</i>.&nbsp; Ah, Mr. Laureate, Mr. Laureate, that
&ldquo;quidlibet audendi&rdquo; of yours may now and then gild
the poet, at the same time that it makes the historian cut a
sorry figure!</p>
<p>Could Father Nobrega rise from the tomb, he would thus address
you:&mdash;&ldquo;Ungrateful Englishman, you have drawn a great
part of your information from the writings of the Society of
Jesus, and in return you attempt to stain its character by
telling your countrymen that &lsquo;we taught the idolatry we
believed!&rsquo;&nbsp; In speaking of me, you say, it was my
happy fortune to be stationed in a country where <i>none</i> but
the good principles of my order were called into action.&nbsp;
Ungenerous laureate, the narrow policy of the times has kept your
countrymen in the dark with regard to the true character of the
Society of Jesus; and you draw the bandage still tighter over
their eyes by a malicious insinuation.&nbsp; I lived, and taught,
and died in Brazil, where you state that <i>none</i> but the good
principles of my order were called into action, and still, in
most absolute contradiction to this, you remark we believed <!--
page 135--><a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
135</span>the <i>idolatry</i> we taught in Brazil.&nbsp; Thus we
brought none but good principles into action, and still taught
idolatry!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Again, you state there is no individual to whose
talents Brazil is so greatly and permanently indebted as mine,
and that I must be regarded as the founder of that system so
successfully pursued by the Jesuits in Paraguay; a system
productive of as much good as is compatible with pious
fraud.&nbsp; Thus you make me, at one and the same time, a
teacher of none but good principles, and a teacher of idolatry,
and a believer in idolatry, and still the founder of a system for
which Brazil is greatly and permanently indebted to me, though,
by-the-bye, the system was only productive of as much good as is
compatible with pious fraud!</p>
<p>&ldquo;What means all this?&nbsp; After reading such
incomparable nonsense, should your countrymen wish to be properly
informed concerning the Society of Jesus, there are in England
documents enough to show that the system of the Jesuits was a
system of Christian charity towards their fellow-creatures,
administered in a manner which human prudence judged best
calculated to ensure success; and that the idolatry which you
uncharitably affirm they taught was really and truly the very
same faith which the Catholic Church taught for centuries in
England, which she <!-- page 136--><a name="page136"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 136</span>still teaches to those who wish to
hear her, and which she will continue to teach pure and
unspotted, till time shall be no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The environs of Pernambuco are very pretty.&nbsp; You see
country houses in all directions, and the appearance of here and
there a sugar plantation enriches the scenery.&nbsp; Palm-trees,
cocoa-nut trees, orange and lemon groves, and all the different
fruits peculiar to Brazil, are here in the greatest
abundance.</p>
<p>At Olinda there is a national botanical garden; it wants
space, produce, and improvement.&nbsp; The forests which are
several leagues off, abound with birds, beasts, insects, and
serpents.&nbsp; Besides a brilliant plumage, many of the birds
have a very fine song.&nbsp; The troupiale, noted for its rich
colours, sings delightfully in the environs of Pernambuco.&nbsp;
The red-headed finch, larger than the European sparrow, pours
forth a sweet and varied strain, in company with two species of
wrens, a little before daylight.&nbsp; There are also several
species of the thrush, which have a song somewhat different from
that of the European thrush; and two species of the linnet, whose
strain is so soft and sweet that it dooms them to captivity in
the houses.&nbsp; A bird, called here <i>sangre do buey</i>
(blood of the ox), cannot fail to engage your attention: he is of
the passerine tribe, and very common about the houses; the wings
and tail are black, and every <!-- page 137--><a
name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>other part
of the body a flaming red.&nbsp; In Guiana there is a species
exactly the same as this in shape, note, and economy, but
differing in colour, its whole body being like black velvet; on
its breast a tinge of red appears through the black.&nbsp; Thus
nature has ordered this little tangara to put on mourning to the
north of the line, and wears scarlet to the south of it.</p>
<p>For three months in the year the environs of Pernambuco are
animated beyond description.&nbsp; From November to March the
weather is particularly fine; then it is that rich and poor,
young and old, foreigners and natives, all issue from the city to
enjoy the country, till Lent approaches, when back they hie
them.&nbsp; Villages and hamlets, where nothing before but rags
were seen, now shine in all the elegance of dress; every house,
every room, every shed become eligible places for those whom
nothing but extreme necessity could have forced to live there a
few weeks ago: some join in the merry dance, others saunter up
and down the orange groves; and towards evening the roads become
a moving scene of silk and jewels.&nbsp; The gaming-tables have
constant visitors; there, thousands are daily and nightly lost
and won; parties even sit down to try their luck round the
outside of the door as well as in the room:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Vestibulum ante ipsum primisque in faucibus
aul&aelig;<br />
Luctus et ultrices, posuere sedilia cur&aelig;.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 138--><a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
138</span>About six or seven miles from Pernambuco stands a
pretty little village called Monteiro; the river runs close by
it, and its rural beauties seem to surpass all others in the
neighbourhood; there the Captain-General of Pernambuco resides
during this time of merriment and joy.</p>
<p>The traveller who allots a portion of his time to peep at his
fellow-creatures in their relaxations, and accustoms himself to
read their several little histories in their looks and gestures
as he goes musing on, may have full occupation for an hour or two
every day at this season amid the variegated scenes around the
pretty village of Monteiro.&nbsp; In the evening groups sitting
at the door, he may sometimes see with a sigh how wealth and the
prince&rsquo;s favour cause a booby to pass for a Solon, and be
reverenced as such, while perhaps a poor neglected Camo&euml;ns
stands silent at a distance, awed by the dazzling glare of wealth
and power.&nbsp; Retired from the public road he may see poor
Maria sitting under a palm-tree, with her elbow in her lap and
her head leaning on one side within her hand, weeping over her
forbidden banns.&nbsp; And as he moves on, &ldquo;with wandering
step and slow,&rdquo; he may hear a broken-hearted nymph ask her
faithless swain,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;How could you say my face was fair,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And yet that face forsake;<br />
<!-- page 139--><a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
139</span>How could you win my virgin heart,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet leave that heart to break?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One afternoon, in an unfrequented part not far from Monteiro,
these adventures were near being brought to a speedy and a final
close: six or seven blackbirds, with a white spot betwixt the
shoulders, were making a noise, and passing to and fro on the
lower branches of a tree in an abandoned, weed-grown, orange
orchard.&nbsp; In the long grass underneath the tree, apparently
a pale green grasshopper was fluttering, as though it had got
entangled in it.&nbsp; When you once fancy that the thing you are
looking at is really what you take it for, the more you look at
it the more you are convinced it is so.&nbsp; In the present
case, this was a grasshopper beyond all doubt, and nothing more
remained to be done but to wait in patience till it had settled,
in order that you might run no risk of breaking its legs in
attempting to lay hold of it while it was fluttering&mdash;it
still kept fluttering; and having quietly approached it, intended
to make sure of it&mdash;behold, the head of a large rattlesnake
appeared in the grass close by: an instantaneous spring backwards
prevented fatal consequences.&nbsp; What had been taken for a
grasshopper was, in fact, the elevated rattle of the snake in the
act of announcing that he was quite prepared, though unwilling,
to make a sure and deadly spring.&nbsp; He shortly after passed
slowly from under the orange-tree to the <!-- page 140--><a
name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
140</span>neighbouring wood on the side of a hill: as he moved
over a place bare of grass and weeds, he appeared to be about
eight feet long; it was he who had engaged the attention of the
birds, and made them heedless of danger from another quarter:
they flew away on his retiring; one alone left his little life in
the air, destined to become a specimen, mute and motionless, for
the inspection of the curious in a far distant clime.</p>
<p>It was now the rainy season, the birds were moulting;
fifty-eight specimens of the handsomest of them in the
neighbourhood of Pernambuco had been collected, and it was time
to proceed elsewhere.&nbsp; The conveyance to the interior was by
horses; and this mode, together with the heavy rains, would
expose preserved specimens to almost certain damage.&nbsp; The
journey to Maranham by land would take at least forty days.&nbsp;
The route was not wild enough to engage the attention of an
explorer, or civilised enough to afford common comforts to a
traveller.&nbsp; By sea there were no opportunities, except slave
ships.&nbsp; As the transporting poor negroes from port to port
for sale pays well in Brazil, the ships&rsquo; decks are crowded
with them.&nbsp; This would not do.</p>
<p>Excuse here, benevolent reader, a small tribute of gratitude
to an Irish family, whose urbanity and goodness have long gained
it the esteem and respect of all <!-- page 141--><a
name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>ranks in
Pernambuco.&nbsp; The kindness and attention I received from
Dennis Kearney, Esq., and his amiable lady, will be remembered
with gratitude to my dying day.</p>
<p>After wishing farewell to this hospitable family, I embarked
on board a Portuguese brig, with poor accommodation, for Cayenne
in Guiana.&nbsp; The most eligible bedroom was the top of a
hen-coop on deck.&nbsp; Even here, an unsavoury little beast,
called bug, was neither shy nor deficient in appetite.</p>
<p>The Portuguese seamen are famed for catching fish.&nbsp; One
evening, under the line, four sharks made their appearance in the
wake of the vessel.&nbsp; The sailors caught them all.</p>
<p>On the fourteenth day after leaving Pernambuco, the brig cast
anchor off the island of Cayenne.&nbsp; The entrance is
beautiful.&nbsp; To windward, not far off, there are two bold
wooded islands, called the Father and Mother; and near them are
others, their children, smaller, though as beautiful as their
parents.&nbsp; Another is seen a long way to leeward of the
family, and seems as if it had strayed from home, and cannot find
its way back.&nbsp; The French call it &ldquo;l&rsquo;enfant
perdu.&rdquo;&nbsp; As you pass the islands, the stately hills on
the main, ornamented with ever-verdant foliage, show you that
this is by far the sublimest scenery on the sea-coast, from the
Amazons to the Oroonoque.&nbsp; On casting your eye <!-- page
142--><a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
142</span>towards Dutch Guiana, you will see that the mountains
become unconnected, and few in number, and long before you reach
Surinam the Atlantic wave washes a flat and muddy shore.</p>
<p>Considerably to windward of Cayenne, and about twelve leagues
from land, stands a stately and towering rock, called the
Constable.&nbsp; As nothing grows on it to tempt greedy and
aspiring man to claim it as his own, the sea-fowl rest and raise
their offspring there.&nbsp; The bird called the frigate is ever
soaring round its rugged summit.&nbsp; Hither the phaeton bends
his rapid flight, and flocks of rosy flamingos here defy the
fowler&rsquo;s cunning.&nbsp; All along the coast, opposite the
Constable, and indeed on every uncultivated part of it to
windward and leeward, are seen innumerable quantities of
snow-white egrets, scarlet curlews, spoonbills, and
flamingos.</p>
<p>Cayenne is capable of being a noble and productive
colony.&nbsp; At present it is thought to be the poorest on the
coast of Guiana.&nbsp; Its estates are too much separated one
from the other by immense tracts of forest; and the revolutionary
war, like a cold eastern wind, has chilled their zeal and blasted
their best expectations.</p>
<p>The clove-tree, the cinnamon, pepper, and nutmeg, and many
other choice spices and fruits of the eastern and Asiatic
regions, produce abundantly in Cayenne.</p>
<p><!-- page 143--><a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
143</span>The town itself is prettily laid out, and was once well
fortified.&nbsp; They tell you it might easily have been defended
against the invading force of the two united nations; but Victor
Hugues, its governor, ordered the tri-coloured flag to be struck;
and ever since that day the standard of Braganza has waved on the
ramparts of Cayenne.</p>
<p>He who has received humiliations from the hand of this
haughty, iron-hearted governor, may see him now in Cayenne,
stripped of all his revolutionary honours, broken down and
ruined, and under arrest in his own house.&nbsp; He has four
accomplished daughters, respected by the whole town.&nbsp;
Towards the close of day, when the sun&rsquo;s rays are no longer
oppressive, these much-pitied ladies are seen walking up and down
the balcony with their aged parent, trying, by their kind and
filial attention, to remove the settled gloom from his too guilty
brow.</p>
<p>This was not the time for a traveller to enjoy Cayenne.&nbsp;
The hospitality of the inhabitants was the same as ever, but they
had lost their wonted gaiety in public, and the stranger might
read in their countenances, as the recollection of recent
humiliations and misfortunes every now and then kept breaking in
upon them, that they were still in sorrow for their fallen
country: the victorious hostile cannon of Waterloo still sounded
in their ears; their Emperor was a prisoner <!-- page 144--><a
name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>amongst the
hideous rocks of St. Helena; and many a Frenchman who had fought
and bled for France was now amongst them begging for a little
support to prolong a life which would be forfeited on the parent
soil.&nbsp; To add another handful to the cypress and wormwood
already scattered amongst these polite colonists, they had just
received orders from the court of Janeiro to put on deep mourning
for six months, and half-mourning for as many more, on account of
the death of the Queen of Portugal.</p>
<p>After a day&rsquo;s journey in the interior is the celebrated
national plantation.&nbsp; This spot was judiciously chosen, for
it is out of the reach of enemies&rsquo; cruisers.&nbsp; It is
called La Gabrielle.&nbsp; No plantation in the western world can
vie with La Gabrielle.&nbsp; Its spices are of the choicest kind;
its soil particularly favourable to them; its arrangements
beautiful; and its directeur, Monsieur Martin, a botanist of
first-rate abilities.&nbsp; This indefatigable naturalist ranged
through the East, under a royal commission, in quest of botanical
knowledge; and during his stay in the western regions has sent
over to Europe from twenty to twenty-five thousand specimens in
botany and zoology.&nbsp; La Gabrielle is on a far-extending
range of woody hills.&nbsp; Figure to yourself a hill in the
shape of a bowl reversed, with the buildings on the top of it,
and you will have an idea of the appearance of La
Gabrielle.&nbsp; You approach the <!-- page 145--><a
name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>house
through a noble avenue, five hundred toises long, of the choicest
tropical fruit-trees, planted with the greatest care and
judgment; and should you chance to stray through it after sunset,
when the clove-trees are in blossom, you would fancy yourself in
the Idalian groves, or near the banks of the Nile, where they
were burning the finest incense as the Queen of Egypt passed.</p>
<p>On La Gabrielle there are twenty-two thousand clove-trees in
full bearing.&nbsp; They are planted thirty feet asunder.&nbsp;
Their lower branches touch the ground.&nbsp; In general the trees
are topped at five-and-twenty feet high; though you will see some
here towering up above sixty.&nbsp; The black pepper, the
cinnamon, and nutmeg are also in great abundance here, and very
productive.</p>
<p>While the stranger views the spicy groves of La Gabrielle, and
tastes the most delicious fruits which have originally been
imported hither from all parts of the tropical world, he will
thank the Government which has supported, and admire the talents
of the gentleman who has raised to its present grandeur, this
noble collection of useful fruits.&nbsp; There is a large nursery
attached to La Gabrielle, where plants of all the different
species are raised and distributed gratis to those colonists who
wish to cultivate them.</p>
<p>Not far from the banks of the river Oyapoc, to windward of
Cayenne, is a mountain which contains an <!-- page 146--><a
name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>immense
cavern.&nbsp; Here the cock-of-the-rock is plentiful.&nbsp; He is
about the size of a fantail-pigeon, his colour a bright orange,
and his wings and tail appear as though fringed; his head is
ornamented with a superb double-feathery crest, edged with
purple.&nbsp; He passes the day amid gloomy damps and silence,
and only issues out for food a short time at sunrise and
sunset.&nbsp; He is of the gallinaceous tribe.&nbsp; The
South-American Spaniards call him &ldquo;gallo del Rio
Negro&rdquo; (cock of the Black River), and suppose that he is
only to be met with in the vicinity of that far-inland stream;
but he is common in the interior of Demerara, amongst the huge
rocks in the forests of Macoushia; and he has been shot south of
the line, in the captainship of Para.</p>
<p>The bird called by Buffon <i>grand gobemouche</i> has never
been found in Demerara, although very common in Cayenne.&nbsp; He
is not quite so large as the jackdaw, and is entirely black,
except a large spot under the throat, which is a glossy
purple.</p>
<p>You may easily sail from Cayenne to the river Surinam in two
days.&nbsp; Its capital, Paramaribo, is handsome, rich, and
populous: hitherto it has been considered by far the finest town
in Guiana; but probably the time is not far off when the capital
of Demerara may claim the prize of superiority.&nbsp; You may
enter a creek above Paramaribo, and travel <!-- page 147--><a
name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>through the
interior of Surinam, till you come to the Nacari, which is close
to the large river Coryntin.&nbsp; When you have passed this
river, there is a good public road to New Amsterdam, the capital
of Berbice.</p>
<p>On viewing New Amsterdam, it will immediately strike you that
something or other has intervened to prevent its arriving at that
state of wealth and consequence for which its original plan shows
it was once intended.&nbsp; What has caused this stop in its
progress to the rank of a fine and populous city remains for
those to find out who are interested in it; certain it is that
New Amsterdam has been languid for some years, and now the tide
of commerce seems ebbing fast from the shores of Berbice.</p>
<p>Gay and blooming is the sister colony of Demerara.&nbsp;
Perhaps, kind reader, thou hast not forgot that it was from
Stabroek, the capital of Demerara, that the adventurer set out,
some years ago, to reach the Portuguese frontier fort, and
collected the wourali-poison.&nbsp; It was not intended, when
this second sally was planned in England, to have visited
Stabroek again by the route here described.&nbsp; The plan was to
have ascended the Amazons from Para and got into the Rio Negro,
and from thence to have returned towards the source of the
Essequibo, in order to examine the crystal mountains, and look
once more for Lake Parima, or the White Sea; but on arriving at
Cayenne, the <!-- page 148--><a name="page148"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 148</span>current was running with such
amazing rapidity to leeward, that a Portuguese sloop, which had
been beating up towards Para for four weeks, was then only
half-way.&nbsp; Finding, therefore, that a beat to the Amazons
would be long, tedious, and even uncertain, and aware that the
season for procuring birds with fine plumage had already set in,
I left Cayenne in an American ship for Paramaribo, went through
the interior to the Coryntin, stopped a few days in New
Amsterdam, and proceeded to Demerara.&nbsp; If, gentle reader,
thy patience be not already worn out, and thy eyes half closed in
slumber, by perusing the dull adventures of this second sally,
perhaps thou wilt pardon a line or two on Demerara; and then we
will retire to its forests, to collect and examine the economy of
its most rare and beautiful birds, and give the world a new mode
of preserving them.</p>
<p>Stabroek, the capital of Demerara, has been rapidly increasing
for some years back; and if prosperity go hand in hand with the
present enterprising spirit, Stabroek, ere long, will be of the
first colonial consideration.&nbsp; It stands on the eastern bank
at the mouth of the Demerara, and enjoys all the advantages of
the refreshing sea-breeze; the streets are spacious,
well-bricked, and elevated, the trenches clean, the bridges
excellent, and the houses handsome.&nbsp; Almost every commodity
and luxury of London may be bought in <!-- page 149--><a
name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 149</span>the shops
at Stabroek; its market wants better regulations.&nbsp; The
hotels are commodious, clean, and well attended.&nbsp; Demerara
boasts as fine and well-disciplined militia as any colony in the
western world.</p>
<p>The court of justice, where, in times of old, the bandage was
easily removed from the eyes of the goddess, and her scales
thrown out of equilibrium, now rises in dignity under the
firmness, talents, and urbanity of Mr. President Rough.</p>
<p>The plantations have an appearance of high cultivation; a
tolerable idea may be formed of their value when you know that
last year Demerara numbered seventy-two thousand nine hundred and
ninety-nine slaves.&nbsp; They made about forty-four million
pounds of sugar, near two million gallons of rum, above eleven
million pounds of coffee, and three million eight hundred and
nineteen thousand five hundred and twelve pounds of cotton; the
receipt into the public chest was five hundred and fifty-three
thousand nine hundred and fifty-six guilders; the public
expenditure, four hundred and fifty-one thousand six hundred and
three guilders.</p>
<p>Slavery can never be defended; he whose heart is not of iron
can never wish to be able to defend it; while he heaves a sigh
for the poor negro in captivity, he wishes from his soul that the
traffic had been stifled in its birth; but, unfortunately, the
Governments of <!-- page 150--><a name="page150"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 150</span>Europe nourished it, and now that
they are exerting themselves to do away the evil, and ensure
liberty to the sons of Africa, the situation of the plantation
slaves is depicted as truly deplorable, and their condition
wretched.&nbsp; It is not so.&nbsp; A Briton&rsquo;s heart,
proverbially kind and generous, is not changed by climate, or its
streams of compassion dried up by the scorching heat of a
Demerara sun; he cheers his negroes in labour, comforts them in
sickness, is kind to them in old age, and never forgets that they
are his fellow-creatures.</p>
<p>Instances of cruelty and depravity certainly occur here as
well as all the world over: but the edicts of the colonial
Government are well calculated to prevent them; and the British
planter, except here and there one, feels for the wrongs done to
a poor ill-treated slave, and shows that his heart grieves for
him by causing immediate redress, and preventing a
repetition.</p>
<p>Long may ye flourish, peaceful and liberal inhabitants of
Demerara!&nbsp; Your doors are ever open to harbour the
harbourless; your purses never shut to the wants of the
distressed: many a ruined fugitive from the Oroonoque will bless
your kindness to him in the hour of need, when, flying from the
woes of civil discord, without food or raiment, he begged for
shelter underneath your roof.&nbsp; The poor sufferer in
Trinidad, who lost his all in the devouring flames, will remember
your charity to his latest moments.&nbsp; The traveller, as <!--
page 151--><a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
151</span>he leaves your port, casts a longing lingering look
behind; your attentions, your hospitality, your pleasantry and
mirth, are uppermost in his thoughts; your prosperity is close to
his heart.&nbsp; Let us now, gentle reader, retire from the busy
scenes of man, and journey on towards the wilds in quest of the
feathered tribe.</p>
<p>Leave behind you your high-seasoned dishes, your wines and
your delicacies; carry nothing but what is necessary for your own
comfort and the object in view, and depend upon the skill of an
Indian, or your own, for fish and game.&nbsp; A sheet, about
twelve feet long, ten wide, painted, and with loop-holes on each
side, will be of great service; in a few minutes you can suspend
it betwixt two trees in the shape of a roof.&nbsp; Under this, in
your hammock, you may defy the pelting shower, and sleep heedless
of the dews of night.&nbsp; A hat, a shirt, and a light pair of
trousers, will be all the raiment you require.&nbsp; Custom will
soon teach you to tread lightly and barefoot on the little
inequalities of ground, and show you how to pass on, unwounded,
amid the mantling briers.</p>
<p>Snakes in these wilds are certainly an annoyance, though
perhaps more in imagination than reality: for you must recollect,
that the serpent is never the first to offend; his poisonous fang
was not given him for conquest: he never inflicts a wound with it
but to defend existence.&nbsp; Provided you walk cautiously, and
do not <!-- page 152--><a name="page152"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 152</span>absolutely touch him, you may pass
in safety close by him.&nbsp; As he is often coiled up on the
ground, and amongst the branches of the trees above you, a degree
of circumspection is necessary, lest you unwarily disturb
him.</p>
<p>Tigers are too few, and too apt to fly before the noble face
of man, to require a moment of your attention.</p>
<p>The bite of the most noxious of the insects, at the very
worst, only causes a transient fever, with a degree of pain more
or less.</p>
<p>Birds in general, with few exceptions, are not common in the
very remote parts of the forest.&nbsp; The sides of rivers,
lakes, and creeks, the borders of savannas, the old abandoned
habitations of Indians and woodcutters, seem to be their
favourite haunts.</p>
<p>Though least in size, the glittering mantle of the
humming-bird entitles it to the first place in the list of the
birds of the New World.&nbsp; It may truly be called the Bird of
Paradise; and had it existed in the Old World, it would have
claimed the title instead of the bird which has now the honour to
bear it.&nbsp; See it darting through the air almost as quick as
thought!&mdash;now it is within a yard of your face!&mdash;in an
instant gone!&mdash;now it flutters from flower to flower to sip
the silver dew&mdash;it is now a ruby&mdash;now a topaz&mdash;now
an emerald&mdash;now all burnished gold!&nbsp; It would be
arrogant to pretend <!-- page 153--><a name="page153"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 153</span>to describe this winged gem of
nature after Buffon&rsquo;s elegant description of it.</p>
<p>Cayenne and Demerara produce the same humming-birds.&nbsp;
Perhaps you would wish to know something of their haunts.&nbsp;
Chiefly in the months of July and August the tree called <i>bois
immortel</i>, very common in Demerara, bears abundance of red
blossom, which stays on the tree some weeks; then it is that most
of the different species of humming-birds are very
plentiful.&nbsp; The wild red sage is also their favourite shrub,
and they buzz like bees around the blossom of the
wallaba-tree.&nbsp; Indeed, there is scarce a flower in the
interior, or on the sea-coast, but what receives frequent visits
from one or other of the species.</p>
<p>On entering the forests, on the rising land in the interior,
the blue and green, the smallest brown, no bigger than the
humblebee, with two long feathers in the tail, and the little
forked-tail purple-throated humming-birds, glitter before you in
ever-changing attitudes.&nbsp; One species alone never shows his
beauty to the sun; and were it not for his lovely shining
colours, you might almost be tempted to class him with the goat
suckers on account of his habits.&nbsp; He is the largest of all
the humming-birds, and is all red and changing gold-green, except
the head, which is black.&nbsp; He has two long feathers in the
tail, which cross each other, and these have gained him the name
of karabimiti, or <!-- page 154--><a name="page154"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 154</span>ara humming-bird, from the
Indians.&nbsp; You will never find him on the sea-coast, or where
the river is salt, or in the heart of the forest, unless fresh
water be there.&nbsp; He keeps close by the side of woody
fresh-water rivers and dark and lonely creeks.&nbsp; He leaves
his retreat before sunrise to feed on the insects over the water;
he returns to it as soon as the sun&rsquo;s rays cause a glare of
light, is sedentary all day long, and comes out again for a short
time after sunset.&nbsp; He builds his nest on a twig over the
water in the unfrequented creeks; it looks like tanned
cow-leather.</p>
<p>As you advance towards the mountains of Demerara, other
species of humming-birds present themselves before you.&nbsp; It
seems to be an erroneous opinion that the humming-bird lives
entirely on honey-dew.&nbsp; Almost every flower of the tropical
climate contains insects of one kind or other; now, the
humming-bird is most busy about the flowers an hour or two after
sunrise and after a shower of rain, and it is just at this time
that the insects come out to the edge of the flower in order that
the sun&rsquo;s rays may dry the nocturnal dew and rain which
they have received.&nbsp; On opening the stomach of the
humming-bird, dead insects are almost always found there.</p>
<p>Next to the humming-birds, the cotingas display the gayest
plumage.&nbsp; They are of the order of passeres, and you number
five species betwixt the sea-coast and <!-- page 155--><a
name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>the rock
Saba.&nbsp; Perhaps the scarlet cotinga is the richest of the
five, and is one of those birds which are found in the deepest
recesses of the forest.&nbsp; His crown is flaming red; to this
abruptly succeeds a dark shining brown, reaching half-way down
the back: the remainder of the back, the rump, and tail, the
extremity of which is edged with black, are a lively red; the
belly is a somewhat lighter red; the breast, reddish-black; the
wings, brown.&nbsp; He has no song, is solitary, and utters a
monotonous whistle which sounds like &ldquo;quet.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
is fond of the seeds of the hitia-tree, and those of the
siloabali and bastard-siloabali trees, which ripen in December,
and continue on the trees for about two months.&nbsp; He is found
throughout the year in Demerara; still nothing is known of his
incubation.&nbsp; The Indians all agree in telling you that they
have never seen his nest.</p>
<p>The purple-breasted cotinga has the throat and breast of a
deep purple, the wings and tail black, and all the rest of the
body a most lively shining blue.</p>
<p>The purple-throated cotinga has black wings and tail, and
every other part a light and glossy blue, save the throat, which
is purple.</p>
<p>The pompadour cotinga is entirely purple, except his wings,
which are white, their four first feathers tipped with
brown.&nbsp; The great coverts of the wings are stiff, narrow,
and pointed, being shaped quite <!-- page 156--><a
name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>different
from those of any other bird.&nbsp; When you are betwixt this
bird and the sun in his flight, he appears uncommonly
brilliant.&nbsp; He makes a hoarse noise, which sounds like
&ldquo;wallababa.&rdquo;&nbsp; Hence his name amongst the
Indians.</p>
<p>None of these three cotingas have a song.&nbsp; They feed on
the hitia, siloabali, and bastard-siloabali seeds, the wild
guava, the fig, and other fruit trees of the forest.&nbsp; They
are easily shot in these trees during the months of December,
January, and part of February.&nbsp; The greater part of them
disappear after this, and probably retire far away to
breed.&nbsp; Their nests have never been found in Demerara.</p>
<p>The fifth species is the celebrated campanero of the
Spaniards, called dara by the Indians and bell-bird by the
English.&nbsp; He is about the size of the jay.&nbsp; His plumage
is white as snow.&nbsp; On his forehead rises a spiral tube
nearly three inches long.&nbsp; It is jet-black, dotted all over
with small white feathers.&nbsp; It has a communication with the
palate, and when filled with air, looks like a spire; when empty,
it becomes pendulous.&nbsp; His note is loud and clear, like the
sound of a bell, and may be heard at the distance of three
miles.&nbsp; In the midst of these extensive wilds, generally on
the dried top of an aged mora, almost out of gun reach, you will
see the campanero.&nbsp; No sound or song from any of the winged
inhabitants of the forest, not even <!-- page 157--><a
name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>the
clearly-pronounced &ldquo;Whip-poor-Will,&rdquo; from the
goatsucker, causes such astonishment as the toll of the
campanero.</p>
<p>With many of the feathered race, he pays the common tribute of
a morning and an evening song; and even when the meridian sun has
shut in silence the mouths of almost the whole of animated
nature, the campanero still cheers the forest.&nbsp; You hear his
toll, and then a pause for a minute, then another toll, and then
a pause again, and then a toll, and again a pause.&nbsp; Then he
is silent for six or eight minutes, and then, another toll, and
so on.&nbsp; Act&aelig;on would stop in mid chase, Maria would
defer her evening song, and Orpheus himself would drop his lute
to listen to him, so sweet, so novel, and romantic is the toll of
the pretty snow-white campanero.&nbsp; He is never seen to feed
with the other cotingas, nor is it known in what part of Guiana
he makes his nest.</p>
<p>While cotingas attract your attention by their superior
plumage, the singular form of the toucan makes a lasting
impression on your memory.&nbsp; There are three species of
toucans in Demerara, and three diminutives, which may be called
toucanets.&nbsp; The largest of the first species frequents the
mangrove-trees on the sea-coast.&nbsp; He is never seen in the
interior till you reach Macoushia, where he is found in the
neighbourhood of the river Tacatou.&nbsp; The other two <!-- page
158--><a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
158</span>species are very common.&nbsp; They feed entirely on
the fruits of the forest, and though of the pie kind, never kill
the young of other birds or touch carrion.&nbsp; The larger is
called bouradi by the Indians (which means &ldquo;nose&rdquo;),
the other, scirou.&nbsp; They seem partial to each other&rsquo;s
company, and often resort to the same feeding tree, and retire
together to the same shady noon-day retreat.&nbsp; They are very
noisy in rainy weather at all hours of the day, and in fair
weather, at morn and eve.&nbsp; The sound which the bouradi makes
is like the clear yelping of a puppy dog, and you fancy he says,
&ldquo;pia-po-o-co,&rdquo; and thus the South American Spaniards
call him piapoco.</p>
<p>All the toucanets feed on the same trees on which the toucan
feeds, and every species of this family of enormous bill lays its
eggs in the hollow trees.&nbsp; They are social, but not
gregarious.&nbsp; You may sometimes see eight or ten in company,
and from this you would suppose they are gregarious; but, upon a
closer examination, yon will find it has only been a dinner
party, which breaks up and disperses towards roosting-time.</p>
<p>You will be at a loss to conjecture for what ends nature has
overloaded the head of this bird with such an enormous
bill.&nbsp; It cannot be for the offensive, as it has no need to
wage war with any of the tribes of animated nature; for its food
is fruits and seeds, and those are in superabundance throughout
the whole <!-- page 159--><a name="page159"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 159</span>year in the regions where the toucan
is found.&nbsp; It can hardly be for the defensive, as the toucan
is preyed upon by no bird in South America, and were it obliged
to be at war, the texture of the bill is ill adapted to give or
receive blows, as you will see in dissecting it.&nbsp; It cannot
be for any particular protection to the tongue, as the tongue is
a perfect feather.</p>
<p>The flight of the toucan is by jerks; in the action of flying
it seems incommoded by this huge disproportioned feature, and the
head seems as if bowed down to the earth by it against its will;
if the extraordinary form and size of the bill expose the toucan
to ridicule, its colours make it amends.&nbsp; Were a specimen of
each species of the toucan presented to you, you would pronounce
the bill of the bouradi the most rich and beautiful; on the ridge
of the upper mandible a broad stripe of most lovely yellow
extends from the head to the point; a stripe of the same breadth,
though somewhat deeper yellow, falls from it at right angles next
the head down to the edge of the mandible; then follows a black
stripe, half as broad, falling at right angles from the ridge,
and running narrower along the edge to within half an inch of the
point.&nbsp; The rest of the mandible is a deep bright red.&nbsp;
The lower mandible has no yellow; its black and red are
distributed in the same manner as on the upper one, with this
difference, that there is black about an inch from the
point.&nbsp; The stripe <!-- page 160--><a
name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
160</span>corresponding to the deep yellow stripe on the upper
mandible is sky blue.&nbsp; It is worthy of remark that all these
brilliant colours of the bill are to be found in the plumage of
the body, and the bare skin round the eye.</p>
<p>All these colours, except the blue, are inherent in the horn;
that part which appears blue is in reality transparent white, and
receives its colour from a thin piece of blue skin inside.&nbsp;
This superb bill fades in death, and in three or four days&rsquo;
time has quite lost its original colours.</p>
<p>Till within these few years no idea of the true colours of the
bill could be formed from the stuffed toucans brought to
Europe.&nbsp; About eight years ago, while eating a boiled
toucan, the thought struck me that the colours in the bill of a
preserved specimen might be kept as bright as those in
life.&nbsp; A series of experiments proved this beyond a
doubt.&nbsp; If you take your penknife and cut away the roof of
the upper mandible, you will find that the space betwixt it and
the outer shell contains a large collection of veins, and small
osseous fibres running in all directions through the whole extent
of the bill.&nbsp; Clear away all these with your knife, and you
will come to a substance more firm than skin, but of not so
strong a texture as the horn itself; cut this away also, and
behind it is discovered a thin and tender membrane: yellow where
<!-- page 161--><a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
161</span>it has touched the yellow part of the horn, blue where
it has touched the red part, and black towards the edge and
point.&nbsp; When dried, this thin and tender membrane becomes
nearly black; as soon as it is cut away, nothing remains but the
outer horn, red and yellow, and now become transparent.&nbsp; The
under mandible must undergo the same operation.&nbsp; Great care
must be taken, and the knife used very cautiously when you are
cutting through the different parts close to where the bill joins
on to the head: if you cut away too much, the bill drops off; if
you press too hard, the knife comes through the horn; if you
leave too great a portion of the membrane, it appears through the
horn, and by becoming black when dried, makes the horn appear
black also, and has a bad effect.&nbsp; Judgment, caution, skill,
and practice will ensure success.</p>
<p>You have now cleared the bill of all those bodies which are
the cause of its apparent fading; for, as has been said before,
these bodies dry in death, and become quite discoloured, and
appear so through the horn; and reviewing the bill in this state,
you conclude that its former bright colours are lost.</p>
<p>Something still remains to be done.&nbsp; You have rendered
the bill transparent by the operation, and that transparency must
be done away to make it appear perfectly natural.&nbsp; Pound
some clean chalk, and give <!-- page 162--><a
name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>it enough
water till it be of the consistency of tar; add a proportion of
gum-arabic to make it adhesive; then take a camel-hair brush, and
give the inside of both mandibles a coat; apply a second when the
first is dry, then another, and a fourth to finish all.&nbsp; The
gum-arabic will prevent the chalk from cracking and falling
off.&nbsp; If you remember, there is a little space of
transparent white on the lower mandible which originally appeared
blue, but which became transparent white as soon as the thin
piece of blue skin was cut away; this must be painted blue
inside.&nbsp; When all this is completed, the bill will please
you; it will appear in its original colours.&nbsp; Probably your
own abilities will suggest a cleverer mode of operating than the
one here described.&nbsp; A small gouge would assist the
penknife, and render the operation less difficult.</p>
<p>The houtou ranks high in beauty amongst the birds of
Demerara&mdash;his whole body is green, with a bluish cast in the
wings and tail; his crown, which he erects at pleasure, consists
of black in the centre, surrounded with lovely blue of two
different shades: he has a triangular black spot, edged with
blue, behind the eye, extending to the ear; and on his breast a
sable tuft, consisting of nine feathers edged also with
blue.&nbsp; This bird seems to suppose that its beauty can be
increased by trimming the tail, which undergoes the <!-- page
163--><a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
163</span>same operation as our hair in a barber&rsquo;s shop,
only with this difference, that it uses its own beak, which is
serrated, in lieu of a pair of scissors; as soon as his tail is
full grown, he begins about an inch from the extremity of the two
longest feathers in it, and cuts away the web on both sides of
the shaft, making a gap about an inch long; both male and female
Adonise their tails in this manner, which gives them a remarkable
appearance amongst all other birds.&nbsp; While we consider the
tail of the houtou blemished and defective, were he to come
amongst us he would probably consider our heads, cropped and
bald, in no better light.&nbsp; He who wishes to observe this
handsome bird in his native haunts must be in the forest at the
morning&rsquo;s dawn.&nbsp; The houtou shuns the society of man:
the plantations and cultivated parts are too much disturbed to
engage it to settle there; the thick and gloomy forests are the
places preferred by the solitary houtou.&nbsp; In those
far-extending wilds, about daybreak, you hear him articulate, in
a distinct and mournful tone, &ldquo;Houtou, houtou.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Move cautiously on to where the sound proceeds from, and you will
see him sitting in the underwood, about a couple of yards from
the ground, his tail moving up and down every time he articulates
&ldquo;houtou.&rdquo;&nbsp; He lives on insects and the berries
amongst the underwood, and very rarely is seen in the lofty
trees, except the bastard-<!-- page 164--><a
name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>siloabali
tree, the fruit of which is grateful to him.&nbsp; He makes no
nest, but rears his young in a hole in the sand, generally on the
side of a hill.</p>
<p>While in quest of the houtou you will now and then fall in
with the jay of Guiana, called by the Indians ibibirou.&nbsp; Its
forehead is black, the rest of the head white; the throat and
breast like the English magpie: about an inch of the extremity of
the tail is white, the other part of it, together with the back
and wings, a greyish changing purple; the belly is white: there
are generally six or eight of them in company; they are shy and
garrulous, and tarry a very short time in one place; they are
never seen in the cultivated parts.</p>
<p>Through the whole extent of the forest, chiefly from sunrise
till nine o&rsquo;clock in the morning, you hear a sound of
&ldquo;Wow, wow, wow, wow.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is the bird called
boclora by the Indians.&nbsp; It is smaller than the common
pigeon, and seems, in some measure, to partake of its nature; its
head and breast are blue; the back and rump somewhat resemble the
colour on the peacock&rsquo;s neck; its belly is a bright yellow;
the legs are so very short that it always appears as if sitting
on the branch; it is as ill-adapted for walking as the swallow;
its neck, for above an inch all round, is quite bare of feathers,
but this deficiency is not seen, for it always sits with its head
<!-- page 165--><a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
165</span>drawn in upon its shoulders: it sometimes feeds with
the cotingas on the guava and hitia trees; but its chief
nutriment seems to be insects, and, like most birds which follow
this prey, its chaps are well armed with bristles: it is found in
Demerara at all times of the year, and makes a nest resembling
that of the stock-dove.&nbsp; This bird never takes long flights,
and when it crosses a river or creek it goes by long jerks.</p>
<p>The boclora is very unsuspicious, appearing quite heedless of
danger: the report of a gun within twenty yards will not cause it
to leave the branch on which it is sitting, and you may often
approach it so near as almost to touch it with the end of your
bow.&nbsp; Perhaps there is no bird known whose feathers are so
slightly fixed to the skin as those of the boclora.&nbsp; After
shooting it, if it touch a branch in its descent, or if it drop
on hard ground, whole heaps of feathers fall off; on this account
it is extremely hard to procure a specimen for
preservation.&nbsp; As soon as the skin is dry in the preserved
specimen, the feathers become as well fixed as those in any other
bird.</p>
<p>Another species, larger than the boclora, attracts much of
your notice in these wilds; it is called cuia by the Indians,
from the sound of its voice; its habits are the same as those of
the boclora, but its colours different; its head, breast, back,
and rump are a <!-- page 166--><a name="page166"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 166</span>shining, changing green; its tail
not quite so bright; a black bar runs across the tail towards the
extremity; and the outside feathers are partly white, as in the
boclora; its belly is entirely vermilion, a bar of white
separating it from the green on the breast.</p>
<p>There are diminutives of both these birds; they have the same
habits, with a somewhat different plumage, and about half the
size.&nbsp; Arrayed from head to tail in a robe of richest sable
hue, the bird called rice-bird loves spots cultivated by the hand
of man.&nbsp; The woodcutter&rsquo;s house on the hills in the
interior, and the planter&rsquo;s habitation on the sea-coast,
equally attract this songless species of the order of pie,
provided the Indian corn be ripe there.&nbsp; He is nearly of the
jackdaw&rsquo;s size, and makes his nest far away from the haunts
of men; he may truly be called a blackbird: independent of his
plumage, his beak, inside and out, his legs, his toes, and claws,
are jet black.</p>
<p>Mankind, by clearing the ground, and sowing a variety of
seeds, induces many kinds of birds to leave their native haunts
and come and settle near him; their little depredations on his
seeds and fruits prove that it is the property, and not the
proprietor, which has the attractions.</p>
<p>One bird, however, in Demerara, is not actuated by selfish
motives; this is the cassique; in size, he is larger than the
starling; he courts the society of man, <!-- page 167--><a
name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>but
disdains to live by his labours.&nbsp; When nature calls for
support, he repairs to the neighbouring forest, and there
partakes of the store of fruits and seeds which she has produced
in abundance for her a&euml;rial tribes.&nbsp; When his repast is
over, he returns to man, and pays the little tribute which he
owes him for his protection; he takes his station on a tree close
to his house, and there, for hours together, pours forth a
succession of imitative notes.&nbsp; His own song is sweet, but
very short.&nbsp; If a toucan be yelping in the neighbourhood, he
drops it, and imitates him.&nbsp; Then he will amuse his
protector with the cries of the different species of the
woodpecker; and when the sheep bleat, he will distinctly answer
them.&nbsp; Then comes his own song again; and if a puppy-dog or
a Guinea-fowl interrupt him, he takes them off admirably, and by
his different gestures during the time, you would conclude that
he enjoys the sport.</p>
<p>The cassique is gregarious, and imitates any sound he hears
with such exactness, that he goes by no other name than that of
mocking-bird amongst the colonists.</p>
<p>At breeding-time, a number of these pretty choristers resort
to a tree near the planter&rsquo;s house, and from its outside
branches weave their pendulous nests.&nbsp; So conscious do they
seem that they never give offence, and so little suspicious are
they of receiving any injury <!-- page 168--><a
name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>from man,
that they will choose a tree within forty yards from his house,
and occupy the branches so low down, that he may peep into the
nests.&nbsp; A tree in Waratilla creek affords a proof of
this.</p>
<p>The proportions of the cassique are so fine, that he may be
said to be a model of symmetry in ornithology.&nbsp; On each wing
he has a bright yellow spot, and his rump, belly, and half the
tail are of the same colour.&nbsp; All the rest of the body is
black.&nbsp; His beak is the colour of sulphur, but it fades in
death, and requires the same operation as the bill of the toucan
to make it keep its colours.&nbsp; Up the rivers, in the
interior, there is another cassique, nearly the same size, and of
the same habits, though not gifted with its powers of
imitation.&nbsp; Except in breeding time, you will see hundreds
of them retiring to roost, amongst the mocamoca-trees and low
shrubs on the banks of the Demerara, after you pass the first
island.&nbsp; They are not common on the sea-coast.&nbsp; The
rump of the cassique is a flaming scarlet.&nbsp; All the rest of
the body is a rich glossy black.&nbsp; His bill is sulphur
colour.&nbsp; You may often see numbers of this species weaving
their pendulous nests on one side of a tree, while numbers of the
other species are busy in forming theirs on the opposite side of
the same tree.&nbsp; Though such near neighbours, the females are
never observed to kick up a row, or come to blows!</p>
<p><!-- page 169--><a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
169</span>Another species of cassique, as large as a crow, is
very common in the plantations.&nbsp; In the morning he generally
repairs to a large tree, and there, with his tail spread over his
back, and shaking his lowered wings, he produces notes which,
though they cannot be said to amount to a song, still have
something very sweet and pleasing in them.&nbsp; He makes his
nest in the same form as the other cassiques.&nbsp; It is above
four feet long; and when you pass under the tree, which often
contains fifty or sixty of them, you cannot help stopping to
admire them as they wave to and fro, the sport of every storm and
breeze.&nbsp; The rump is chestnut; ten feathers of the tail are
a fine yellow, the remaining two, which are the middle ones, are
black, and an inch shorter than the others.&nbsp; His bill is
sulphur colour; all the rest of the body black, with here and
there shades of brown.&nbsp; He has five or six long narrow black
feathers on the back of his head, which he erects at
pleasure.</p>
<p>There is one more species of cassique in Demerara, which
always prefers the forest to the cultivated parts.&nbsp; His
economy is the same as that of the other cassiques.&nbsp; He is
rather smaller than the last described bird.&nbsp; His body is
greenish, and his tail and rump paler than those of the
former.&nbsp; Half of his beak is red.</p>
<p>You would not be long in the forests of Demerara without
noticing the woodpeckers.&nbsp; You meet with <!-- page 170--><a
name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>them
feeding at all hours of the day.&nbsp; Well may they do so.&nbsp;
Were they to follow the example of most of the other birds, and
only feed in the morning and evening, they would be often on
short allowance, for they sometimes have to labour three or four
hours at the tree before they get to their food.&nbsp; The sound
which the largest kind makes in hammering against the bark of the
tree is so loud, that you would never suppose it to proceed from
the efforts of a bird.&nbsp; You would take it to be the woodman,
with his axe, trying by a sturdy blow, often repeated, whether
the tree were sound or not.&nbsp; There are fourteen species
here; the largest the size of a magpie, the smallest no bigger
than the wren.&nbsp; They are all beautiful; and the greater part
of them have their heads ornamented with a fine crest, movable at
pleasure.</p>
<p>It is said, if you once give a dog a bad name, whether
innocent or guilty, he never loses it; it sticks close to him
wherever he goes.&nbsp; He has many a kick and many a blow to
bear on account of it; and there is nobody to stand up for
him.&nbsp; The woodpecker is little better off.&nbsp; The
proprietors of woods in Europe have long accused him of injuring
their timber, by boring holes in it, and letting in the water,
which soon rots it.&nbsp; The colonists in America have the same
complaint against him.&nbsp; Had he the power of speech, which
Ovid&rsquo;s birds possessed in days of yore, he could soon <!--
page 171--><a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
171</span>make a defence.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mighty lord of the
woods,&rdquo; he would say to man, &ldquo;why do you wrongfully
accuse me? why do you hunt me up and down to death for an
imaginary offence?&nbsp; I have never spoiled a leaf of your
property, much less your wood.&nbsp; Your merciless shot strikes
me at the very time I am doing you a service.&nbsp; But your
short-sightedness will not let you see it, or your pride is above
examining closely the actions of so insignificant a little bird
as I am.&nbsp; If there be that spark of feeling in your breast
which they say man possesses, or ought to possess, above all
other animals, do a poor injured creature a little kindness, and
watch me in your woods only for one day.&nbsp; I never wound your
healthy trees.&nbsp; I should perish for want in the
attempt.&nbsp; The sound bark would easily resist the force of my
bill: and were I even to pierce through it, there would be
nothing inside that I could fancy, or my stomach digest.&nbsp; I
often visit them, it is true, but a knock or two convince me that
I must go elsewhere for support; and were you to listen
attentively to the sound which my bill causes, you would know
whether I am upon a healthy or an unhealthy tree.&nbsp; Wood and
bark are not my food.&nbsp; I live entirely upon the insects
which have already formed a lodgment in the distempered
tree.&nbsp; When the sound informs me that my prey is there, I
labour for hours together till I get at it; and by consuming it,
for my own support, I prevent its further <!-- page 172--><a
name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
172</span>depredations in that part.&nbsp; Thus I discover for
you your hidden and unsuspected foe, which has been devouring
your wood in such secrecy, that you had not the least suspicion
it was there.&nbsp; The hole which I make in order to get at the
pernicious vermin will be seen by you as you pass under the
tree.&nbsp; I leave it as a signal to tell you that your tree has
already stood too long.&nbsp; It is past its prime.&nbsp;
Millions of insects, engendered by disease, are preying upon its
vitals.&nbsp; Ere long it will fall a log in useless ruins.&nbsp;
Warned by this loss, cut down the rest in time, and spare, O
spare the unoffending woodpecker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the rivers, and different creeks, you number six species of
the kingfisher.&nbsp; They make their nest in a hole in the sand
on the side of the bank.&nbsp; As there is always plenty of
foliage to protect them from the heat of the sun, they feed at
all hours of the day.&nbsp; Though their plumage is prettily
varied, still it falls far short of the brilliancy displayed by
the English kingfisher.&nbsp; This little native of Britain would
outweigh them altogether in the scale of beauty.</p>
<p>A bird called jacamar is often taken for a kingfisher, but it
has no relationship to that tribe; it frequently sits in the
trees over the water, and as its beak bears some resemblance to
that of the kingfisher, this may probably account for its being
taken for one; it feeds entirely upon insects; it sits on a
branch in <!-- page 173--><a name="page173"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 173</span>motionless expectation, and as soon
as a fly, butterfly, or moth passes by, it darts at it, and
returns to the branch it had just left.&nbsp; It seems an
indolent, sedentary bird, shunning the society of all others in
the forest.&nbsp; It never visits the plantations, but is found
at all times of the year in the woods.&nbsp; There are four
species of jacamar in Demerara; they are all beautiful; the
largest, rich and superb in the extreme.&nbsp; Its plumage is of
so fine a changing blue and golden green, that it may be ranked
with the choicest of the humming birds.&nbsp; Nature has denied
it a song, but given a costly garment in lieu of it.&nbsp; The
smallest species of jacamar is very common in the dry
savannas.&nbsp; The second size, all golden green on the back,
must be looked for in the wallaba forest.&nbsp; The third is
found throughout the whole extent of these wilds; and the fourth,
which is the largest, frequents the interior, where you begin to
perceive stones in the ground.</p>
<p>When you have penetrated far into Macoushia, you hear the
pretty songster called troupiale pour forth a variety of sweet
and plaintive notes.&nbsp; This is the bird which the Portuguese
call the nightingale of Guiana; its predominant colours are rich
orange and shining black, arrayed to great advantage; his
delicate and well-shaped frame seems unable to bear
captivity.&nbsp; The Indians sometimes bring down troupiales to
Stabroek, but in a few months they languish and die in a
cage.&nbsp; <!-- page 174--><a name="page174"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 174</span>They soon become very familiar; and
if you allow them the liberty of the house, they live longer than
in a cage, and appear in better spirits; but, when you least
expect it, they drop down and die in epilepsy.</p>
<p>Smaller in size, and of colour not so rich and somewhat
differently arranged, another species of troupiale sings
melodiously in Demerara.&nbsp; The woodcutter is particularly
favoured by him; for while the hen is sitting on her nest, built
in the roof of the woodcutter&rsquo;s house, he sings for hours
together close by: he prefers the forests to the cultivated
parts.</p>
<p>You would not grudge to stop for a few minutes, as you are
walking in the plantations, to observe a third species of
troupiale: his wings, tail, and throat are black; all the rest of
the body is a bright yellow.&nbsp; There is something very sweet
and plaintive in his song, though much shorter than that of the
troupiale in the interior.</p>
<p>A fourth species goes in flocks from place to place in the
cultivated parts at the time the Indian corn is ripe; he is all
black, except the head and throat, which are yellow; his attempt
at song is not worth attending to.</p>
<p>Wherever there is a wild fig-tree ripe, a numerous species of
birds, called tangara, is sure to be on it.&nbsp; There are
eighteen beautiful species here.&nbsp; Their plumage is very rich
and diversified; some of them boast <!-- page 175--><a
name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>six
separate colours; others have the blue, purple, green, and black
so kindly blended into each other, that it would be impossible to
mark their boundaries; while others again exhibit them strong,
distinct, and abrupt: many of these tangaras have a fine
song.&nbsp; They seem to partake much of the nature of our
linnets, sparrows, and finches.&nbsp; Some of them are fond of
the plantations; others are never seen there, preferring the wild
seeds of the forest to the choicest fruits planted by the hand of
man.</p>
<p>On the same fig-trees to which they repair, and often
accidentally up and down the forest, you fall in with four
species of manikin.&nbsp; The largest is white and black, with
the feathers on the throat remarkably long; the next in size is
half red and half black; the third, black, with a white crown;
the fourth, black, with a golden crown, and red feathers at the
knee.&nbsp; The half red and half black species is the
scarcest.&nbsp; There is a creek in the Demerara called
Camouni.&nbsp; About ten minutes from the mouth, you see a
common-sized fig-tree on your right-hand, as you ascend, hanging
over water; it bears a very small fig twice a year.&nbsp; When
its fruit is ripe, this manikin is on the tree from morn till
eve.</p>
<p>On all the ripe fig-trees in the forest you see the bird
called the small tiger-bird.&nbsp; Like some of our belles and
dandies, it has a gaudy vest to veil an <!-- page 176--><a
name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>ill-shaped
body: the throat, and part of the head, are a bright red; the
breast and belly have black spots on a yellow ground; the wings
are a dark green, black, and white; and the rump and tail black
and green.&nbsp; Like the manikin, it has no song: it depends
solely upon a showy garment for admiration.</p>
<p>Devoid, too, of song, and in a still superber garb, the
yawaraciri comes to feed on the same tree.&nbsp; It has a bar
like black velvet from the eyes to the beak; its legs are yellow;
its throat, wings, and tail black; all the rest of the body a
charming blue.&nbsp; Chiefly in the dry savannas, and here and
there accidentally in the forest, you see a songless yawaraciri
still lovelier than the last: his crown is whitish blue, arrayed
like a coat of mail; his tail is black, his wings black and
yellow, legs red, and the whole body a glossy blue.&nbsp; Whilst
roving through the forest, ever and anon you see individuals of
the wren species busy amongst the fallen leaves, or seeking
insects at the roots of the trees.</p>
<p>Here, too, you find six or seven species of small birds, whose
backs appear to be overloaded with silky plumage.&nbsp; One of
these, with a chestnut breast, smoke-coloured back, tail red,
white feathers like horns on his head, and white narrow-pointed
feathers under the jaw, feeds entirely upon ants.&nbsp; When a
nest of large, light brown ants emigrates, one following the
other in <!-- page 177--><a name="page177"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 177</span>meandering lines above a mile long,
you see this bird watching them, and every now and then picking
them up.&nbsp; When they disappear he is seen no more: perhaps
this is the only kind of ant he is fond of; when these ants are
stirring, you are sure to find him near them.&nbsp; You cannot
well mistake the ant after you have once been in its company, for
its sting is very severe, and you can hardly shoot the bird, and
pick it up, without having five or six upon you.</p>
<p>Parrots and paroquets are very numerous here, and of many
different kinds.&nbsp; You will know when they are near you in
the forest, not only by the noise they make, but also by the
fruits and seeds which they let fall while they are feeding.</p>
<p>The hia-hia parrot, called in England the &ldquo;parrot of the
sun,&rdquo; is very remarkable: he can erect at pleasure a fine
radiated circle of tartan feathers quite round the back of his
head from jaw to jaw.&nbsp; The fore-part of his head is white:
his back, tail, and wings green; and his breast and belly
tartan.</p>
<p>Superior in size and beauty to every parrot of South America,
the ara will force you to take your eyes from the rest of
animated nature and gaze at him: his commanding strength, the
flaming scarlet of his body, the lovely variety of red, yellow,
blue, and green in his wings, the extraordinary length of his
scarlet and blue tail seem all to join and demand for him the
title of <!-- page 178--><a name="page178"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 178</span>&ldquo;emperor of all the
parrots.&rdquo;&nbsp; He is scarce in Demerara till you reach the
confines of the Macoushi country; there he is in vast abundance;
he mostly feeds on trees of the palm species.&nbsp; When the
coucourite-trees have ripe fruit on them, they are covered with
this magnificent parrot: he is not shy or wary; you may take your
blow-pipe and quiver of poisoned arrows, and kill more than you
are able to carry back to your hut.&nbsp; They are very
vociferous, and, like the common parrots, rise up in bodies
towards sunset, and fly two and two to their place of rest.&nbsp;
It is a grand sight in ornithology to see thousands of aras
flying over your head, low enough to let you have a full view of
their flaming mantle.&nbsp; The Indians find their flesh very
good, and the feathers serve for ornaments in their
head-dresses.&nbsp; They breed in the holes of trees, are easily
reared and tamed, and learn to speak pretty distinctly.</p>
<p>Another species frequents the low lands of Demerara.&nbsp; He
is nearly the size of the scarlet ara, but much inferior in
plumage.&nbsp; Blue and yellow are his predominant colours.</p>
<p>Along the creeks and river sides, and in the wet savannas, six
species of the bittern will engage your attention.&nbsp; They are
all handsome.&nbsp; The smallest is not so large as the English
water-hen.</p>
<p>In the savannas, too, you will sometimes surprise the
snow-white egrette, whose back is adorned with <!-- page 179--><a
name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>the plumes
from which it takes its name.&nbsp; Here, too, the spur-winged
water-hen, the blue and green water-hen, and two other species of
ordinary plumage are found.&nbsp; While in quest of these, the
blue heron, the large and small brown heron, the boat-bill, and
Muscovy duck now and then rise up before you.</p>
<p>When the sun has sunk in the western woods, no longer agitated
by the breeze; when you can only see a straggler or two of the
feathered tribe hastening to join its mate, already at its
roosting-place, then it is that the goatsucker comes out of the
forest, where it has sat all day long in slumbering ease,
unmindful of the gay and busy scenes around it.&nbsp; Its eyes
are too delicately formed to bear the light, and thus it is
forced to shun the flaming face of day, and wait in patience till
night invites him to partake of the pleasures her dusky presence
brings.</p>
<p>The harmless, unoffending goatsucker, from the time of
Aristotle down to the present day, has been in disgrace with
man.&nbsp; Father has handed down to son, and author to author,
that this nocturnal thief subsists by milking the flocks.&nbsp;
Poor injured little bird of night, how sadly hast thou suffered,
and how foul a stain has inattention to facts put upon thy
character!&nbsp; Thou hast never robbed man of any part of his
property, nor deprived the kid of a drop of milk.</p>

180--><a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
180</span>opportunity of examining the goatsucker.&nbsp; You will
see it close by the cows, goats, and sheep, jumping up every now
and then under their bellies.&nbsp; Approach a little
nearer&mdash;he is not shy, &ldquo;he fears no danger, for he
knows no sin.&rdquo;&nbsp; See how the nocturnal flies are
tormenting the herd, and with what dexterity he springs up and
catches them, as fast as they alight on the belly, legs, and
udder of the animals.&nbsp; Observe how quiet they stand, and how
sensible they seem of his good offices, for they neither strike
at him, nor hit him with their tail, nor tread on him, nor try to
drive him away as an uncivil intruder.&nbsp; Were you to dissect
him, and inspect his stomach, you would find no milk there.&nbsp;
It is full of the flies which have been annoying the herd.</p>
<p>The prettily-mottled plumage of the goatsucker, like that of
the owl, wants the lustre which is observed in the feathers of
the birds of day.&nbsp; This at once marks him as a lover of the
pale moon&rsquo;s nightly beams.&nbsp; There are nine species
here.&nbsp; The largest appears nearly the size of the English
wood-owl.&nbsp; Its cry is so remarkable that, having once heard
it, you will never forget it.&nbsp; When night reigns over these
immeasurable wilds, whilst lying in your hammock, you will hear
this goatsucker lamenting like one in deep distress.&nbsp; A
stranger would never conceive it to be the cry of a bird.&nbsp;
He would say it was the departing voice of a midnight-murdered
victim, or the last wailing of Niobe <!-- page 181--><a
name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>for her
poor children, before she was turned into stone.&nbsp; Suppose
yourself in hopeless sorrow, begin with a high loud note, and
pronounce, &ldquo;Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha,&rdquo; each note
lower and lower, till the last is scarcely heard, pausing a
moment or two betwixt every note, and you will have some idea of
the moaning of the largest goatsucker in Demerara.</p>
<p>Four other species of the goatsucker articulate some words so
distinctly, that they have received their names from the
sentences they utter, and absolutely bewilder the stranger on his
arrival in these parts.&nbsp; The most common one sits down close
by your door, and flies and alights three or four yards before
yon, as you walk along the road, crying, &ldquo;Who-are-you,
who-who-who-are-you?&rdquo;&nbsp; Another bids you,
&ldquo;Work-away, work&mdash;work-work-away.&rdquo;&nbsp; A third
cries mournfully, &ldquo;Willy-come-go.&nbsp;
Willy-Willy-Willy-come-go.&rdquo;&nbsp; And high up in the
country, a fourth tells you to &ldquo;Whip-poor-Will.&nbsp;
Whip-whip-whip-poor-Will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You will never persuade the negro to destroy these birds, or
get the Indian to let fly his arrow at them.&nbsp; They are birds
of omen and reverential dread.&nbsp; Jumbo, the demon of Africa,
has them under his command; and they equally obey the Yabahou, or
Demerara Indian devil.&nbsp; They are the receptacles for
departed souls, who come back again to earth, unable to rest for
crimes done in their days of nature; or they are <!-- page
182--><a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
182</span>expressly sent by Jumbo, or Yabahou, to haunt cruel and
hard-hearted masters, and retaliate injuries received from
them.&nbsp; If the largest goatsucker chance to cry near the
white man&rsquo;s door, sorrow and grief will soon be inside; and
they expect to see the master waste away with a slow consuming
sickness.&nbsp; If it be heard close to the negro&rsquo;s or
Indian&rsquo;s hut, from that night misfortune sits brooding over
it; and they await the event in terrible suspense.</p>
<p>You will forgive the poor Indian of Guiana for this.&nbsp; He
knows no better; he has nobody to teach him.&nbsp; But shame it
is that, in our own civilised country, the black cat and
broomstaff should be considered as conductors to and from the
regions of departed spirits.</p>
<p>Many years ago I knew poor harmless Mary; old age had marked
her strongly, just as he will mark you and me, should we arrive
at her years and carry the weight of grief which bent her
double.&nbsp; The old men of the village said she had been very
pretty in her youth; and nothing could be seen more comely than
Mary when she danced on the green.&nbsp; He who had gained her
heart left her for another, less fair, though richer than
Mary.&nbsp; From that time she became sad and pensive; the rose
left her cheek, and she was never more seen to dance round the
May-pole on the green: her expectations were blighted; she became
quite indifferent to everything around her, and seemed to think
<!-- page 183--><a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
183</span>of nothing but how she could best attend her mother,
who was lame, and not long for this life.&nbsp; Her mother had
begged a black kitten from some boys who were going to drown it,
and in her last illness she told Mary to be kind to it for her
sake.</p>
<p>When age and want had destroyed the symmetry of Mary&rsquo;s
fine form, the village began to consider her as one who had
dealings with spirits; her cat confirmed the suspicion.&nbsp; If
a cow died, or a villager wasted away with an unknown complaint,
Mary and her cat had it to answer for.&nbsp; Her broom sometimes
served her for a walking-stick; and if over she supported her
tottering frame with it as far as the May-pole, where once, in
youthful bloom and beauty, she had attracted the eyes of all, the
boys would surround her and make sport of her, while her cat had
neither friend nor safety beyond the cottage wall.&nbsp; Nobody
considered it cruel or uncharitable to torment a witch; and it is
probable, long before this, that cruelty, old age, and want have
worn her out, and that both poor Mary and her cat have ceased to
be.</p>
<p>Would you wish to pursue the different species of game, well
stored and boundless is your range in Demerara.&nbsp; Here no one
dogs you, and afterwards clandestinely inquires if you have a
hundred a year in land to entitle you to enjoy such patrician
sport.&nbsp; Here no saucy intruder asks if you have taken out a
licence, <!-- page 184--><a name="page184"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 184</span>by virtue of which you are allowed
to kill the birds which have bred upon your own property.&nbsp;
Here</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;You are as free as when God first made
man,<br />
Ere the vile laws of servitude began,<br />
And wild in woods the noble savage ran.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before the morning&rsquo;s dawn you hear a noise in the
forest, which sounds like &ldquo;duraquaura&rdquo; often
repeated.&nbsp; This is the partridge, a little smaller, and
differing somewhat in colour from the English partridge; it lives
entirely in the forest, and probably the young brood very soon
leave their parents, as you never flush more than two birds in
the same place, and in general only one.</p>
<p>About the same hour, and sometimes even at midnight, you hear
two species of maam, or tinamou, send forth their long and
plaintive whistle from the depth of the forest.&nbsp; The flesh
of both is delicious.&nbsp; The largest is plumper, and almost
equals in size the black cock of Northumberland.&nbsp; The quail
is said to be here, though rare.</p>
<p>The hannaquoi, which some have compared to the pheasant,
though with little reason, is very common.</p>
<p>Here are also two species of the powise, or hocco, and two of
the small wild turkeys called maroudi; they feed on the ripe
fruits of the forest, and are found in all directions in these
extensive wilds.&nbsp; You <!-- page 185--><a
name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>will admire
the horned screamer as a stately and majestic bird: he is almost
the size of the turkey cock; on his head is a long slender horn,
and each wing is armed with a strong, sharp, triangular spur, an
inch long.</p>
<p>Sometimes you will fall in with flocks of two or three hundred
waracabas, or trumpeters, called so from the singular noise they
produce.&nbsp; Their breast is adorned with beautiful changing
blue and purple feathers; their head and neck like velvet; their
wings and back grey, and belly black.&nbsp; They run with great
swiftness, and, when domesticated, attend their master in his
walks with as much apparent affection as his dog.&nbsp; They have
no spurs, but still, such is their high spirit and activity, that
they browbeat every dunghill fowl in the yard, and force the
Guinea birds, dogs, and turkeys to own their superiority.</p>
<p>If, kind and gentle reader, thou shouldst ever visit these
regions with an intention to examine their productions, perhaps
the few observations contained in these Wanderings may be of
service to thee; excuse their brevity; more could have been
written, and each bird more particularly described, but it would
have been pressing too hard upon thy time and patience.</p>
<p>Soon after arriving in these parts, thou wilt find that the
species here enumerated are only as a handful from a well-stored
granary.&nbsp; Nothing has been said <!-- page 186--><a
name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>of the
eagles, the falcons, the hawks, and shrikes; nothing of the
different species of vultures, the king of which is very
handsome, and seems to be the only bird which claims regal
honours from a surrounding tribe.&nbsp; It is a fact beyond all
dispute, that when the scent of carrion has drawn together
hundreds of the common vultures, they all retire from the carcase
as soon as the king of the vultures makes his appearance.&nbsp;
When his majesty has satisfied the cravings of his royal stomach
with the choicest bits from the most stinking and corrupted
parts, he generally retires to a neighbouring tree, and then the
common vultures return in crowds to gobble down his
leavings.&nbsp; The Indians, as well as the whites, have observed
this, for when one of them, who has learned a little English,
sees the king, and wishes you to have a proper notion of the
bird, he says, &ldquo;There is the governor of the carrion
crows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, the Indians have never heard of a personage in Demerara
higher than that of governor; and the colonists, through a common
mistake, call the vultures carrion crows.&nbsp; Hence the Indian,
in order to express the dominion of this bird over the common
vultures, tells you he is governor of the carrion crows.&nbsp;
The Spaniards have also observed it; for, through all the Spanish
Main, he is called &ldquo;rey de zamuros&rdquo;&mdash;king of the
vultures.&nbsp; The many species of owls, too, have <!-- page
187--><a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
187</span>not been noticed; and no mention made of the Columbine
tribe.&nbsp; The prodigious variety of waterfowl on the sea-shore
has been but barely hinted at.</p>
<p>There, and on the borders and surface of the inland waters, in
the marshes and creeks, besides the flamingos, scarlet curlew,
and spoonbills, already mentioned, will be found greenish-brown
curlews, sandpipers, rails, coots, gulls, pelicans, jabirus,
nandapoas, crabiers, snipes, plovers, ducks, geese, cranes, and
anhingas, most of them in vast abundance; some frequenting only
the sea-coast, others only the interior, according to their
different natures; all worthy the attention of the naturalist,
all worthy of a place in the cabinet of the curious.</p>
<p>Should thy comprehensive genius not confine itself to birds
alone, grand is the appearance of other objects all around.&nbsp;
Thou art in a land rich in botany and mineralogy, rich in zoology
and entomology.&nbsp; Animation will glow in thy looks, and
exercise will brace thy frame in vigour.&nbsp; The very time of
thy absence from the tables of heterogeneous luxury will be
profitable to thy stomach, perhaps already sorely drenched with
Londo-Parisian sauces, and a new stock of health will bring thee
an appetite to relish the wholesome food of the chase;
never-failing sleep will wait on thee at the time she comes to
soothe the rest of animated nature; and, ere the sun&rsquo;s rays
appear in the horizon, thou wilt <!-- page 188--><a
name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>spring from
thy hammock fresh as April lark.&nbsp; Be convinced, also, that
the dangers and difficulties which are generally supposed to
accompany the traveller in his journey through distant regions,
are not half so numerous or dreadful as they are commonly thought
to be.</p>
<p>The youth who incautiously reels into the lobby of Drury Lane,
after leaving the table sacred to the god of wine, is exposed to
more certain ruin, sickness, and decay than he who wanders a
whole year in the wilds of Demerara.&nbsp; But this will never be
believed; because the disasters arising from dissipation are so
common and frequent in civilised life, that man becomes quite
habituated to them; and sees daily victims sink into the tomb
long before their time, without ever once taking alarm at the
causes which precipitated them headlong into it.</p>
<p>But the dangers which a traveller exposes himself to in
foreign parts are novel, out-of-the-way things to a man at
home.&nbsp; The remotest apprehension of meeting a tremendous
tiger, of being carried off by a flying dragon, or having his
bones picked by a famished cannibal&mdash;oh, that makes him
shudder.&nbsp; It sounds in his ears like the bursting of a
bomb-shell.&nbsp; Thank Heaven, he is safe by his own
fireside!</p>
<p>Prudence and resolution ought to be the traveller&rsquo;s
constant companions.&nbsp; The first will cause him to <!-- page
189--><a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
189</span>avoid a number of snares which he will find in the path
as he journeys on; and the second will always lend a hand to
assist him, if he has unavoidably got entangled in them.&nbsp;
The little distinctions which have been shown him at his own home
ought to be forgotten when he travels over the world at large;
for strangers know nothing of his former merits, and it is
necessary that they should witness them before they pay him the
tribute which he was wont to receive within his own doors.&nbsp;
Thus, to be kind and affable to those we meet, to mix in their
amusements, to pay a compliment or two to their manners and
customs, to respect their elders, to give a little to their
distressed and needy, and to feel, as it were, at home amongst
them, is the sure way to enable you to pass merrily on, and to
find other comforts as sweet and palatable as those which you
were accustomed to partake of amongst your friends and
acquaintance in your own native land.</p>
<p>We will now ascend in fancy on Icarian wing, and take a view
of Guiana in general.&nbsp; See an immense plain, betwixt two of
the largest rivers in the world, level as a bowling-green, save
at Cayenne, and covered with trees along the coast quite to the
Atlantic wave, except where the plantations make a little vacancy
amongst the foliage.</p>
<p>Though nearly in the centre of the torrid zone, the <!-- page
190--><a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
190</span>sun&rsquo;s rays are not so intolerable as might be
imagined, on account of the perpetual verdure and refreshing
north-east breeze.&nbsp; See what numbers of broad and rapid
rivers intersect it in their journey to the ocean, and that not a
stone or a pebble is to be found on their banks, or in any part
of the country, till your eye catches the hills in the
interior.&nbsp; How beautiful and magnificent are the lakes in
the heart of the forests, and how charming the forests
themselves, for miles after miles on each side of the
rivers!&nbsp; How extensive appear the savannas, or natural
meadows, teeming with innumerable herds of cattle, where the
Portuguese and Spaniards are settled, but desert as Sahara where
the English and Dutch claim dominion.&nbsp; How gradually the
face of the country rises!&nbsp; See the sand-hills all clothed
in wood first emerging from the level, then hills a little
higher, rugged with bold and craggy rocks, peeping out from
amongst the most luxuriant timber.&nbsp; Then come plains, and
dells, and far-extending valleys, arrayed in richest foliage; and
beyond them, mountains piled on mountains, some bearing
prodigious forests, others of bleak and barren aspect.&nbsp; Thus
your eye wanders on, over scenes of varied loveliness and
grandeur, till it rests on the stupendous pinnacles of the
long-continued Cordilleras de los Andes, which rise in towering
majesty, and command all America.</p>
<p>How fertile must the lowlands be, from the <!-- page 191--><a
name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
191</span>accumulation of fallen leaves and trees for
centuries.&nbsp; How propitious the swamps and slimy beds of the
rivers, heated by a downward sun, to the amazing growth of
alligators, serpents, and innumerable insects.&nbsp; How inviting
the forests to the feathered tribes, where you see buds,
blossoms, green and ripe fruit, full-grown and fading leaves, all
on the same tree.&nbsp; How secure the wild beasts may rove in
endless mazes.&nbsp; Perhaps those mountains, too, which appear
so bleak and naked, as if quite neglected, are, like Potosi, full
of precious metals.</p>
<p>Let us now return the pinions we borrowed from Icarus, and
prepare to bid farewell to the wilds.&nbsp; The time allotted to
these Wanderings is drawing fast to a close.&nbsp; Every day for
the last six months has been employed in paying close attention
to natural history in the forests of Demerara.&nbsp; Above two
hundred specimens of the finest birds have been collected, and a
pretty just knowledge formed of their haunts and economy.&nbsp;
From the time of leaving England, in March, 1816, to the present
day, nothing has intervened to arrest a fine flow of health,
saving a quartan ague, which did not tarry, but fled as suddenly
as it appeared.</p>
<p>And now I take leave of thee, kind and gentle reader.&nbsp;
The new mode of preserving birds, heretofore promised thee, shall
not be forgotten.&nbsp; The plan is <!-- page 192--><a
name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 192</span>already
formed in imagination, and can be penned down during the passage
across the Atlantic.&nbsp; If the few remarks in these Wanderings
shall have any weight in inciting thee to sally forth and explore
the vast and well-stored regions of Demerara, I have gained my
end.&nbsp; Adieu.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
